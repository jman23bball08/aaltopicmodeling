I really love being on my college campus– it honestly feels more like home than where I actually live. I tend to feel depressed and get intrusive thoughts when I leave school. Luckily I was able to stay on campus for fall semester, but I just came home for the holidays. I feel sad and I miss my friends so much. Also Flash games are ending December 31st, and they used to be pretty important to me, so it feels like a huge part of my childhood is about to disappear. I don't know how to deal with all of this. Does anyone else relate to this? Does anyone know anything that can make me feel better? Should I be distracting myself or is there a way to face this in a more productive way? (Or can anyone send me a virtual hug cause, haha, I need one).
So my boyfriend and I have been dating for 1+ year long distance and we recently got in an argument where we have not been talking for the last few days. He talked to me yesterday and I asked him if he wanted two of his favourite foods. He replied that he hadn't eaten anything but junk food the last couple days, so I ordered him food (smoothie and sandwich) and had it delivered to his house. He got really mad at me because I wasn't giving him the space he needed to heal. His brother got mad at me too and called me manipulative because he said I'm trying to bribe him with food. In my culture, making sure others are fed shows that you care. Am I in the wrong? TL;DR my boyfriend and I got in an argument, I bought him food since he hadn't eaten, he got pissed at me
I want everybody to know my name. To be famous forever. Most importantly I want to know why I don't feel important today because I feel like if I was happy I wouldn't need everybody to know my name. The phscological reason behind it. I want to know what fucked me up so why I have to be important. Like why am I so sad. Nothing is wrong in my life I have a nice job my family is put together ish. I don't have it that bad but I am dying on the inside. I DONT feel anything anymore unless I'm drunk.
My best friend has never had a boyfriend and it’s really starting to get her down. She’s pretty and is a blast to be around but she’s very introverted and rarely gets the chance to meet new people. She has tried tinder but doesn’t want to go back to it, and the only single friend I have really wouldn’t be a good match for her. It’s getting to me seeing her like this because she’s starting to think she’s worthless. Is there anything I can do to help her find a boyfriend? (ie encourage her to join a sports club or something with me?) Tl;dr: my best friend really wants/needs a boyfriend, how can I help her find one?
I’ve lost pets before but none more sad than quasy he was the runt of his litter and also one of the cutest I loved them but sadly one day he just.. disappeared we didn’t see him anywhere and we just couldn’t find him my mom said he was probably under the house somewhere because there was a gap in the dirt next to our house that led under it and he went there a lot but he wasn’t there sadly we moved to a bigger house so we didn’t have a chance to find him to this day I still remember him and i like to think his ghost is still here with me.
Numb. Numb is better than feeling. I don't know what I feel. Or maybe I do. But it's always too much. Every time I start to think I'm getting a grip, that I'm in control - I don't and I'm not. Every time I think things will be different, they're not. There must be something wrong with me. It's me. Who makes the rules? I don't know. Maybe everyone makes their own and I live by them. I don't trust my own. I don't know myself anymore. My thoughts, my feelings; are they real? Are they true? Are they valid? I wish I was a slab of ice. Thick, solid, cold. I wish I cared less. I wish I would stop victimising myself. It's exhausting. I'm exhausted. Things won't change, but I guess I can... I don't want to show myself anymore. Am I worth it? Stop crying.
I'm 19, M, I'll try to keep this short. Essentially I don't feel normal when I'm around other people. They seem to be talking, socializing, and happy, and I try to copy or mimic the way other people socialize or act to feel normal. I try to smile, say hello, and do normal stuff, but it feels extremely fake, almost like I'm a robot. I can't really find anything to talk about, for example in class, people are chatting and stuff and I'm just looking and pretending like I know what's going on. I can't really remember things that well either so I'll forget what I'm talking about in conversation. I've tried to make changes, I got a hobby I really enjoy, I've been reading, trying to get out of my comfort zone more, talk to more people, go on dates, recently I got another job, I've been trying to improve my confidence by clearing up my acne, doing weights and working on my body language. I've stopped using weed as much as I used to, keeping it to max 3x last month, as well as stopping most porn usage. All these things said I feel pretty unhappy right now. This past two weeks I haven't been sleeping well, going to sleep at 2 and waking around 8-9, just thinking and getting in my head. I honestly feel there could be something wrong with me mentally and I'm unsure what to do.
I have been diagnosed with anxiety but I have always had symptoms. Growing up I was always scared of public places but I worked on it an got better. I even got to the point where I was a teacher. Then all of the sudden I quit my job and things got worse. I shut down to the point were I stopped going anywhere. For the majority of this decade I have not stepped outside my home for more than a few minutes at a time. I feel into a depression and gained weight. I haven't even been to the doctor in that time. I have been having low blood sugar for a while now. Earlier this month I noticed blood in my saliva and my heart starting beating fast from the fear. It was light blood and not much and it happened twice earlier this month. Earlier this morning I had a scratchy throat. I coughed up and there was blood.once again it wasn't a lot. I live with my sister so I woke her and was going to ask her to take me to the hospital. All of the sudden I started having a panic attack. I kept thinking the worst and had fear that going there was just to hear bad news. I have been trying to work myself to go for a check-up this past month, but Everytime I think about it I panic. I fear that once I get to this hospital I am going to get worse. I have never been on this sub before. I guess I'm just looking for encouragement or any advice that might help me. I know it's vital to go to doctor on a regular basis but this is so terrifying for me.
Look, I get it, you come in and hear me talking down the mic about how "I think this is a really bad idea, no no no NO" and you get concerned I might be upsetting the people in a game. Heres what you don't get. These people are all gold rank. They've heard alot worse. These people are all playing ranked. Rank with people on mics discussing tactics &gt; then silent party The people who get upset about being told they've come up with a bad idea, don't play ranked at gold level. And now your saying lets just do our own thing but your still insisting on sitting in my room while you roll through tumblr and facebook. FFs were adults not teenagers, if you don't agree with something women up and either accept the situation isn't entirely as you see it or stand by it and bugger off.
This is the only place I can get advice from people that I know won't be biased. Just so y'all know, we've been dating 3 months, and we've been exclusive for 1. Anyway, the other day my boyfriend got a bit somber about some things that have been troubling him. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it, but he was at work, and so he said he didn't want to get upset while he was there (which I totally understand). Now I'm torn between wanting to ask him what was bothering him, or just leaving it be and letting him bring it up. I was thinking maybe I should just leave it be, but he also seemed like he wanted to talk about it... I am really curious about his problem, and I think that this would be a great bonding experience for us. What do you think I should do? TLDR: Should I mind my own business or pry?
So after several lengthy phone conversations and now a hang out, I'm wondering how I should go about asking my ex to start over. Our hangout was pleasant, painting some rooms together in my parents' house. Our conversations while painting were much like the ones we had when we were dating; easy, pretty casual, et cetera. The silences were comfortable and (at least from my perspective), neither of us were forcing conversation to fill these silences, either. The same has been true of our phone conversations as well. Neither of us cheated on the other; our breakup was caused by issues that I feel were misunderstandings that turned into something bigger than they were (he broke up with me). The break up was about six weeks ago, and we've been talking for about three and a half. This has been the only time I've seen him since the breakup. Should I see him more before I go about asking him to start over, or should I rip the band aid off? --- tl;dr: Ex and I hung out for the first time since our breakup six weeks ago. In my gut, I feel like there's still something there. Should I wait to ask him out again or do I rip the band aid off?
What is it. A lack of company? Being alone? How can I tell when I've never had anyone around me. For sure I have my brother,sister,mom and dad. They are the only things keeping me alive but none of them understand. For the first time my dad saw me cry since I broke my arm at ten.(I'm a guy shouldn't cry yeah) I told them I have no friends.i told them I've never had anyone besides them. No one else ever truly cares abt me. They said I just need to try harder but sometimes no matter how hard you try no matter how kind,friendly or how good a friend you are. Sometimes they just won't be there. But like I said the only thing keeping me alive. Is the knowledge that my close family is there for me. No matter how bad you feel there is always at least one person who cares about you. And If you can't think of anyone I care about you because I am beside you in your pain.
This is my first loss. Today it’s been less that 48 hours since I took that pill in the ER. It was less than 24 hours when my fiancé and I found out some things about his bio daughter and her visits at her bio mothers house. I raise her full time since we have custody. I consider her mine. I feel like I have to push my miscarriage to the side right now and worry about her and her wellbeing. I don’t know how to cope with this right now. I know life doesn’t stop because this happened. I know my daughter really needs me right now. I’m distracted by this. No, I don’t want to lie in bed all day and cry. But I still want to grieve the loss of my baby. Especially since it JUST happened. I know this is all over the place. My mind is a wreck. I’m tired. mentally, physically, emotionally. I just want my baby back.
My thoughts are dominated by violence. Whenever I go to a new place my immediate thoughts are about the environment and how I can use it to my advantage. "That lamp will make a good bludgeon." "Push that fucker into the glass." I feel like a damned psychopath with all the thoughts of how I can get away with crimes. I'm afraid of saying how I really feel because I would be drugged and locked up indefinitely. Even my recreation is dominated by violence, like violent video games and shooting rifles. I'm afraid that I will snap again, but this time ending up hurting those around me. Back then I would just get mad and be a little punk kid, the worst I have ever really done was beating up another kid. I'm a grown man now. I'm in my prime and work out constantly, I can easily overpower the average person. I own a small armory. It's not the fact that I might go postal that scares me, it's the fact that I will be efficient at it.
A question for those with experience with long distance relationships. How do you deal with being apart? I'm 23 and I've never been in a serious relationship until now. I won't go into the hows and whys, but I am now. We've both expressed our love for each other and our wishes to be with each other, etc. etc. However he says he'd rather wait a while before we meet for the first time as he wants to lose weight for me before we do. I'm not exactly in shape myself, so I want to do the same (I have motivation to do so now after all), but besides the point, I don't care what he looks like. I fell in love with the guy I started talking to. (Just FYI, we've swapped plenty of photos and voice chat 4-5 times a week, so I know he's genuine, if you know what I mean.) With all that in mind, as much as I still want to go meet him in person ASAP, he's on about meeting at a convention in Aug. I'd rather not wait that long, I feel I can't, but if I have to I will if it'd make him more comfortable. I don't want to force anything you know? And so, my question is, how do you keep a LDR interesting? Obviously I've googled it already, and I know all the cliche stuff like care packages and letters and such, but does anyone have any other alternative but unique tips and tricks? I'd love to know. =3 --- **tl;dr**: In a LDR, might not meet for 6+ months yet, how to keep things fresh and interesting in the meantime? c:
I don’t know what to do. She was a 13 year old chubby beagle who would snore and waddle around. I had her since I was 8. She’s been with me since before my parents divorced and I don’t think I can even remember life before her. It’s not as hard to accept that she’s gone right now...I’m more dreading the upcoming days of not seeing her white face looking at me or getting excited about me bringing home a treat. The emptiness of her not being there is what scares me. If anyone has some words of advice or comfort or anything it’s all welcome.
I am angry about the way the news is so racial. When it’s a black killed by a white. That is how it is read. But when it’s other way around it reads. Man killed by another man. It doesn’t specify he was killed by a black man. This is why the country is so angry at whites. I don’t see why they don’t just stop using race as a way to get people riled up. And Reddit is becoming worse than twitter to me. Have to be so careful there are so many touchy people out there. I’m so glad I don’t have to be in the world each day.
My six week old son died unexpectedly. The ER staff could only guess a metabolic disorder of some sort. The medical examiner won’t have a report for 3+ months and I literally hurt so much every day I can’t breath. We have 7 kids all fostered/adopted and I get up every day for them and my husband. Waking up in the morning first to his empty bedside sleeper and now just to an empty space hurts so much. And falling asleep without listening to his funny little half snore and every moment and memory in between feels like I’m being eviscerated. My body is a physical aching reminder of his absence and everything seems just dull. I keep having panic attacks and Randomly my whole chest will tighten up and I can’t breathe. I blame myself for somehow not knowing that he had some mystery problem. I am his mom, I’m supposed to keep him safe and somehow I failed. I just want answers. How did he die? Why did he die? Why us? Why after the miscarriages and the infertility and the surprise joy and perfection of his life is he gone now? I was 100% satisfied with our life before he came along, but now it’s just missing so much. How am I supposed to move on knowing how much I’m missing? Will I feel this way everyday for the rest of my life? We have appointments with a counselor and I’ve been invited to a moms who lost kids group but I just don’t know how anything is ever going to “help.” Will I just spend the rest of my life managing?
For example I smashed my finger in the door of a safe a little while ago and I became extremely angry and yelled and cursed. About a week ago I got very angry when I hurt my shin pretty badly so that my leg swelled up and I was also bleeding from a large cut. I got very very angry. Sometimes when I get angry like this I look for something to smash or kick. It is the only time when I get angry enough to actually be violent. Do other people experience this and how did you deal with it?
I'm 4 weeks out from my D&C. I've been using the HCG strips every couple of days to see if my levels are dropping. The strips are still showing as very dark. My beta was 111,000 before my D&C. I peed on one this morning and it was a bit darker than the previous one. Same brand of strip, however a different, newer batch. Is it possible it's just darker because of the batch? We haven't been having protected sex but I didn't think it was possible to get pregnant again with such a high HCG this soon from the miscarriage. I finished bleeding less than a week ago from the D&C. I'm just a bit confused. My OB didn't have me do follow up betas after the procedure but also didn't tell me how long it would be until I had a negative pregnancy test. Also said we did not need to wait for a period to try again. Just unsure if I should be making an appointment with my OB or GP. Thanks!
wednesday night around 10:30p, one of my best friends texted me saying she had tried to attempt suicide. i believe i did everything i could. i sent some of my friends that live in her area, who i am SO thankful for, to check on her. when they got there it took us awhile to figure out which apartment was hers because i didn’t have an address but only her location services from her phone. they eventually found it. she invited them in and they told me that they talked and painted together. around 2a my friends said they were heading out for the night and the last message i got from my dear friend was “i don’t wanna take my life anymore”. her phone was off all day yesterday and i called the police 6 times, starting at 6a, to get a wellness check. they finally found her body last night around 8p and i got the call at 10:30p saying that she had been found deceased. i am in shock. i can’t wrap my head around this. i’ve texted her several times hoping it was a sick joke. i am so unbelievably sad and i wish i could’ve saved her. i can’t help but think if i had driven the 6 hours to get to her, maybe i could’ve done something. does this pain ever go away? i am desperate edit: typo
I am a (24M). Public speaking has always been the most terrifying thing I've had to face throughout my life. I know most people have some degree of stage fright, but for me it truly feels paralyzing. Over the years I have had to do presentations in front of people and it has always gone poorly at least in my eyes and I became a totally different person in a bad way. Always have been a total wreck leading up to and during the speech. One of my good friends is getting married in a few months and I was asked to be his best man which would involve me giving a short speech or toast in front of the whole crowd. I agreed to do it since he is my good friend and I am honored that he chose me for it, but I am a nervous wreck about it even months in advance to the point I don't know how I am going to muster it up since my anxiety is so bad. If I end up going through with it I'll probably have to get really drunk and I don't want to make a fool of myself. I was hoping to get some advice or words of comfort on how I could deal with this situation and if I should even go through with it or if I should back out. Feel free to share any stage fright anxiety stories of your own because I think it helps to know that I am not alone with this crippling anxiety.
Hi all - sorry to post this. My uncle died today - he was very ill with depression and took his own life. He should have been getting more professional help and support but unfortunately didn't. My parents haven't exactly kept me in the loop with my extended family - I wasn't even aware he was unwell. This sounds harsh but I'm not grieving for him - we weren't close and I've only seen him once (at my grandmother's funeral) in the last 15/20 years. I feel bad of course, but its like hearing that someone you didn't know has died. It's my dad - he's obviously distraught and I want to do anything I can to help - does anyone have any advice? What would you have liked your family to have done when you're grieving?
I have a problem with impulsive bursts of anger. If I feel someone has disrespected me, I start to seethe and fantasize about hurting them back either emotionally or physically. I think it goes back to my childhood. My mother was an emotionally domineering and abusive person, especially if someone contradicted her own opinion. She once even threatened to punch me because I didn't ask my father who she was divorced from to take me out to an expensive burger restaurant during one of the visitations. Most of my life I felt like I was walking on eggshells. As an adult I tried to get away from her only to be pulled back into it when the system deemed her mentally incompetent and assigned her into my care. At least at that point I could emotionally abuse her back (I frequently called her a bitch to her face) and though I held back from physical abuse at times I really wanted to beat her bloody. Anyway, she's dead now but everytime I feel disrespected either in person or over the web I have a knee jerk reaction of impulse anger that makes me want to hurt them back. Sometimes I even think I deliberately seek out antagonizing situations and interactions just to feel the rush from anger because without it I just feel dead inside.
I'm 30 years old and going back to school to earn my degree to become a teacher. I work two jobs and take as many classes as I can manage during the semester, which is usually about two. I have 3 years left for all of my schooling. I know I'm getting a super late start on things but I made some mistakes when I was young and I'm trying to rectify them. The other night my girlfriend was telling me that she wanted to have children within the next year and, "does NOT want to be a super old mother at 35-36." I asked her how she felt with her and I being in school and working and she said that she felt she could do it because "lots of people do." I love her so much, she's the best girlfriend I've ever had. But I feel like bringing a child into the world when we have so many things going on and not completely stable with our finances is borderline irresponsible. Friends keep giving me the line of "well there is no RIGHT TIME to have a kid." And I get frustrated because I don't think they're actually hearing what I'm saying. I don't want her compromising her desires of having a kid now for my wanting to wait just to have her resent me. I also don't want to have a kid until I'm financially stable. I've been a mess these last few days thinking about the possible outcomes. Any clarity would be a big help. --- **tl;dr**: Girlfriend wants kids within the next year. I want to wait, as we are not financially ready among other things. Breakup imminent?
I honestly don't know what's wrong with me. This is probably going to be some rambling and uncohesivie thoughts, but I don't know where else to turn. On the outside I'm a very funny and goofy guy. But inside I'm just full of hate and anger. I'm angry at the parents that gave birth to me, such selfish people who had no business creating life. I hate my parents and before you think this is a rant of a teenager, I'm not. I'm 33. I hate my family. I hate the life I was given. I hate the fact that I'm 33 and haven't done anything for myself except be divorced and working a mall cop job living in the ghetto because it's the only place I can afford, while everyone else I know is living the good life with their amazing careers and beautiful homes and beautiful families. I have no friends, unless you call TV and movie character friends. I'm judgemental and full of anger and I don't know how to stop it. I have a girlfriend that has put up with me and all I do is push her away. I love being alone. If I could spend my life sitting on a couch watching shows and movies all day I would. I pretend I'm smart when deep down inside I know I'm dumb, I mean if I was truly smart why am I just a mall cop at the age of 33? I don't know what to do but I feel like I'm drowning. Am I mentally sick and I don't know it? Depression? I have no Idea Oh well, I know this won't get read but at least I got some release.
Throwaway because my boyfriend knows my Reddit id. A little background. I've been with my boyfriend for three years, lived together for two. He is my soulmate in every way. I trust him and he trusts me. We are both loving and committed to each other (We have even had the marriage and kids talks and are both on the same page) In the past year or so I've found other more "holistic" ways to cope with my anxity and panic. It's been slowly getting easier to handle. My anxity has been with me since birth so I'm sure it will always be there somewhere. This past week has been rough for no apparent reason other then my anxity is tired of being ignored. The little voice that has been almost silenced is back and it's mean. Today is the worst. I'm questioning myself. I'm wondering if my boyfriend is tired of me (how could he not be) I'm starting to think he's not happy and will leave. He had a rough week at work and this week is building to be the same if not worse. I know he loves me. I know he is happy. I know he's not going anywhere. But I can't help but think the opposite. I don't think I can say any of this to him. Not because I don't trust him but because I physically can't say any of this out loud. So I'm sitting here writing to a bunch of strangers on the internet, funny how that is easier, and hoping someone has felt this way before. Sorry for the ramble. I hope this is an okay post and I haven't broken any rules (oh ya, I'm also a chronic worrier) Also sorry about the spelling errors. I'm dyslexic and on mobile.
I love this girl, I really do, and I want to love her. She makes me happy and she supports me with what I want to do with my life, but recently our relationship stopped feeling so magical. I don't really get butterflies anymore. I feel like I don't like her as much, but is that just because I don't know what love without butterflies feels like? I want to love her. I don't want us to fall apart. When I think about the future, she's with me. Is that enough? I used to get worried about her going to parties without me. In the past few months, I've stopped caring about it. At first, I thought it was because I didn't care about her anymore. But it's toxic if you measure your love on your worry of whether your partner will cheat on you right? I think it means I trust her and I've matured. I don't really know what I'm saying anymore. Surely if I want to be with her and want to love her, I can get through this right? Can you fall out of love if you want to love the person? Can someone older than me please shed some light on this situation, if you've gone through similar things? I'd also rather not hear that I am or we are too young to love, I know it's been said by a million stupid lovestruck teens but just like the rest of them, I don't believe it. #TL;DR Honeymoon phase over, help going forward/what does love feel like without butterflies?
I [25f] have been dating this girl [34f] for a little over a year- I was going through a divorce after 8 years, and she was just about to start hers after 15 years. These events have nothing to do with us being together now other than we’re happier with each other than our ex’s. Anyway, she has kids [12m,5m], and has to keep in contact with the dad [34m]. Mainly to keep updates about school stuff/ what’s going on with the kids/ etc. I personally have an irrational dislike that she even talks to him. And I am very unsure of how to handle my feelings about this subject based on that she NEEDS to have contact with him for the kids. Let me just state that my anger is based off the fact that he’s an arrogant piece of trash and has done me wrong in the past. And needless to say has done her so much worse. I’m upset because they talk- and he is very difficult to communicate with which makes her upset and puts a strain on our current relationship together. Her and I have talked about this many times. But for what ever reason, this is an ongoing struggle I seem to not be able to overcome. TL;DR I’ve been irrational about my girlfriend talking to her ex-husband about the kids because she can get very depressed after talking with him. How do I overcome this irrationality? I’m looking for some real advice, or how maybe you have handled a similar situation?
I like this guy, but I will literally flee from him if I get nervous. I literally left his house the first time he asked me on a date. I'm not a touchy-feely person. I'm awkward as hell and the tension is KILLING ME. I know that if I take the next step it'll be easier from here on out but easier said than done. I'm romantically inexperienced (he isn't) so I'm not really sure what to do or say to make a move. TL;DR I'm inexperienced and want a guy I like and trust to make a move. I feel like he won't because he doesn't want to seem creepy, but I want to bone.
my girlfriend who id been dating for a year dumped me because she was going to move soon and wanted to end it as soon as possible before it got even harder. but then i found out she immediately started dating another guy so she lied to me because she hadn’t moved yet and was dating someone else. my grandfather passed away and i miss him so much. i would do everything i could like sleep on a chair next to him to comfort him on his last months. all the UCs i applied too rejected me. my parents are very very disappointed in me, because my older brother went to a very good UC and I’m not going to one. my friends that i’ve been friends with for 4 years are starting to distance themselves from me. they usually go in hangouts without me and if i ever try to hangout with them they just say “maybe idk” and never say anything after, then theyll hangout without me. they also talk down to me all the time and always make fun of me or insult me. i have gained a lottttt more weight and i’m eating a lot unhealthier and getting lazier. i know compared to a lot of people, my life isn’t all too bad, but i am a very very emotionally weak person so all these small things have had big impacts on me. tl;dr i am alone and unwanted sorry i just thought id rant because i have no one else to rant too.
I am currently trying to get an assignment done. It’s three short blurbs about movies I’ve seen already. But every time I get a sentence done, all I can think is “that’s not enough. You’re oversimplifying it. You’re not doing enough”. And then I start to hyperventilate, rage at myself, and start to self harm (scratching skin and pulling hair). I just don’t know how to get this done. Nothing I do is good enough. And it makes me just want to drop out of school and kill myself, because I’ll never do anything anyways, so I might as well end it all. I’m also really bad at confronting panic attacks. They terrify me, so any time I feel one, I just quit what I’m doing. And I can’t keep doing this, but I don’t know how to cope.
You. You could have told me about the fucking book design, about how you CHANGED the WHOLE campaign theme. Could have told me we we were going in a completely different direction. YOU. Could have. Said something. Instead, you decided to bite my head off when I asked for things to finish the presentation for our group. Now, I have to redo the entire PPT by tomorrow. Over 50 slides. Self Created. Fuck you J. I wish my grade didn't suffer so I could let you burn. I almost want to go down with this ship if it meant hurting your grade badly too.
Last year in my freshman year of college I just wanted to party all the time, drink, etc. I loved going to frat parties with my friends and letting loose. Then in the spring I went through hell. My sort of- ex led me on for two months and basically used me for sex. I loved him completely and I was so hurt and devastated when he ended it. This year, I feel different. I knew that I’d changed but I didn’t think it would be like this. Every time I try to go out I regret it. I just feel so out of place standing in the crowded room of a party. Just two months ago I was diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder, and I am medicated for that as well as anxiety. I don’t know what it is, but I feel like the emotional stress I’ve been through has changed me and it makes me so sad. I want to be the girl I was, but I can’t change when I’m still having flashbacks and anxiety attacks when I’m reminded of my past. I just want to be myself again, and I don’t know why I’m not.
Everything seems to make me angry. When I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING! I used to love pets. I looked forward to visiting my sister and playing with her dog ben and her 2 cats. Now the thought of her dog, or any others for that matter, drives me up a wall. I can't enjoy video games anymore. Team games are impossible to enjoy when nobody will play up to my standards. I go completely insane when people, especially children, refuse to even try to make a complete sentence. I'm even at the point where I get upset when I realize I'm lacking a certain type of food. I'm always nice to everyone I meet and I go out of my way to do favors for friends and family but I feel like if I have to go one more day living this fake life I'm going to literally kill someone. All of life's little social protocols are so arbitrary. Society just slowly made up this list of what is acceptable and what is not and I got absolutely no say in it. I am not everyone else. I am just me. I'm scared and angry and I'm up against a wall. I can't even find/hold a job. I'm fortunate enough to have a free ride again due to moving back in with my parents, but my time is running out. I don't even think I have a real point to my post. I just feel like I'm going to explode and I feel like I'm all alone.
First post but i’m desperate - I have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression and I have my ups and downs like all people. But lately I feel like my anxiety is making me think irrational things. I have been dating my AMAZING boyfriend (17m) for two months and we have been friends for 3 years. He tells me he loves me and shows it all the time but my anxiety just keeps telling me he doesn’t really like me and that I am constantly annoying him. I am very open with my feelings and tell him all of this and he keeps reassuring me that it isn’t true. I’m scared that he thinks I don’t trust/ love him when I really do. How do I not like my anxiety ruin this great relationship?
We've been seeing each other for 3.5 months, but known each other for 8 years. I started dating an old friend when I was visiting home a little while back. Things moved really fast but it was incredible and by the time I had to leave we'd fallen love with each other. So we spend two months apart, facetiming and messaging constantly, until he books a flight and comes to visit me. He's staying for a month and I'm over the moon. When he gets here he's super different with me, much colder and seems to be annoyed with me constantly, even though he tells me it's fine and just in my head. A week in we get in an argument, he tells me everything he doesn't like about me and my life here, makes very harsh judgements and says I'm different. Follows this up by telling me he's not sure about his feelings towards me, not sure if he loves me. So obviously I was kinda gutted. He's staying in my apartment, and is usually very busy, but has nothing to do here and is just hanging out. He's never been to the USA before. I'm wondering if this is part of it. But I don't know what to do from here, we've been hanging out and he says he still wants to try to make it work, but I just feel so cold and hurt now, like I don't want to be around him. **TL;DR; : My ldr who is staying with me says he doesn't know if he loves me anymore**.
Hallo im 14 and i think i have clinical depression cuz ive been like having breakdowns very often in the past 2 or 3 years or so idk i just feel really shitty because its me...lol i take advice from people they always say "love yourself" they say its like its really fuckin easy but its not because ive been hating myself for a very long time until now lol and idk i just feel what most people with depression feel ,all of my friends is better without me and want to die and always think of the mistakes they have done...i just posted this because im idk fuck it i have time...i know people love me but idk i just dont feel the love...everyday i think im getting closer and closer to suicide i just really want to end my pain of this shit...only a little amount of people know i have depression like 10 people ,no part of my family knows i have depression...i just really want to die and make my family not cry and be depressed too... Lol sorry for this messy post
Basically, my friends (3) and I all wanted to meet up one day to see the movie. Two days ago, two of my friends couldn’t go, so I obviously didn’t want to go without them. Yesterday, they said they were going to the movie and they did. I don’t think they thought about my feelings because for one, I was the one that wanted all of my friends at the movie, at the same time. Secondly, I have been waiting for forever to see the movie, and they went to see it without me. What do you think I should do? Update: They went to the movie, but said they would with me again. I’m still kind of disappointed. I told them how I feel, but they said it was “already the plan.” (This movie was based off a book and I finished the book first, so I waited for all of them to read it.)
I know this is a first world problem. I know it is childish. I know it could be destructive to my relationship with my wife. What I don't know is how to accept a loss, crushing defeat, etc. while watching a favorite sports team. I yell, swear, freak the fuck out, etc. I need advice on how (if at all) I can watch sports without acting like a maniac. It is like I can't control myself and only after its all over do I realize how I have been behaving. I know this is a problem because after last night I am fear that my wife might get so sick of this that she leaves me. For the record, it is never violent toward another human. Just things like remotes, phones, etc. If this is petty or not, according to Hoyle anger, let me know and I will delete it.
I’ve been working retail and food for the last 6 years! I’m so burnt out, but I finally applied to something extremely different and got an interview. The thing is: it was a video interview! I submitted everything on Tuesday and I’m waiting to hear back. It’s making me so stressed out that I keep opening my email before every meal, after I wake up, before bed, during anything I’m doing. I’ve never had an interview where I recorded my answers. I’ve always gone to someone physically or had phone interviews. I’m not sure what to expect from this. I’m absolutely terrified that I’ll never hear back from them again and I lost my chance. I know that’s the anxiety speaking for me, but I’m just so excited and nervous and a bunch of emotions wrapped in one package right now. Anyway. I just had to get these feelings written down. Thank you for reading!!
I lost my dad in 2017, he was diagnosed with cancer in August and passed away in October. My brother and I (at the time 23/25) dropped everything and moved in with our dad to support him when he got his diagnosis. My brother was living with Canada and came home to Scotland, and I moved from London. He was in a lot of pain from his neck, which is how he was diagnosed, and had an operation on his neck to put in a plate. The whole time he was in and out of hospital suffering an enormous amount of pain, even after the operation. It was crisis after crisis, and involved a lot of very traumatic experiences. My dad was never sick before that. He was crazy strong, ex military, but a big softy, full of quirks and stories and silly jokes. I could talk to him about everything. I've always had very vivid dreams that I remember. I always used to wind up my friends my recounting them in detail. And since losing my dad I've dreamt of him very often. Recently it's been every night, and he's always sick, or just out of reach, and I'm always so very desperate to be with him. I wake up and feel his loss so strongly. I suppose I'm just sharing my experience to help me make sense of it. But please do share if you have a similar experience.
...and that whether or not their grief seems performative or deeply authentic, I can’t ever actually know what is in someone else’s heart, nor what grief might be doing to it. I’m not the damn sorrow police and shouldn’t be. So I know all of this. And I know to be better than what I’m about to write... but the truth is, I resent his sister and the way she always centers her experience in his loss. I feel like she makes her grief so big, and so public, that there’s no space for anyone else’s grief. No space for mine. In the end, I know it doesn’t matter. This isn’t a contest and there’s no monopoly on grief. She can have hers and I will have mine and I needn’t spend any energy at all fretting over her cries for attention. And honestly, I feel shitty that I do. I mean, she lost her *brother*, probably her closest sibling, and that’s huge. I get it. But I’m just so exhausted from making space for her grief and her not leaving any space for mine. Okay. Petty rant done. Thank you and sorry.
Does anyone else from the suburbs or wherever get called “white girl” or “white boy?” I’m black and I was born and raised in the suburbs so I get called white girl pretty often (exclusively by black folks) and it’s really starting to piss me off the older I get. I keep falling into these random conversations. Most recent one was my coworker (black girl from the suburbs) wants to raise her children (when she has them) in the inner city so they don’t think living in the suburbs comes easy and they are around their own people. Wtf!?? Do you get called “white girl or white boy” and how do you handle it?
I was always a decent singer and I didn’t realize how much I liked singing day to day until I couldn’t do it anymore. Essentially, primarily through prescription drugs, my vocal cords have warped on one side. This has taken my voice from being kind of smooth and normal sounding, to a bit deeper and croaky. When I’m speaking I sound pretty normal but if I try to sing I sound like a 13 year old boy whose voice is breaking. I have about three low notes I can hit but the rest sounds insane. Or I can’t hit the note I meant to and it sounds like I’m singing three notes simultaneously. I’m not a singer but this has ended up making me more sad than I’d have realized. I was trying to sing along to the radio the other day and ended up with tears just realizing I’ll never sing along to my favorite songs again, do karaoke, sing with friends etc etc. and there’s nothing I can do to fix it. I know it’s not a terrible disease and I’m lucky in a lot of ways, but I am truly sad that those things are gone. It also made me admire the lovely Julie Andrews even more and use her as my inspiration. If a woman with the most beautiful voice in the world, who sang her whole life, can move on from hers being destroyed then obviously I’ve got no excuse! But it will definitely be something I will always miss dearly
As the title says, I’m anxious about change... always! I desperately want to get out there and date, but my anxiety overwhelms me and all I can do is think of how different things would be. Do I really want to change things that are going so well now? Will the person even want to date me when they find out how crazy i actually am. It’s the same with work. I’m not particularly happy in my line of work, but the thought of finding another job and changing things up terrifies me. I know I could make more money if I just found something, but I don’t want to change! I don’t know what to do. I have my eyes routine and thinking of changing that up is so terrifying. Sorry if this is just a mess of nonsense.... I’m lost on what to do and how to overcome these things. I need help from someone that might understand.
We live in a townhome and we split the rent. It gets to about 30 degrees C / 86 degrees F even at 10 pm and it's humid too (65% according to thermostat whatever that means). Opening the windows doesn't help because hot air from air conditioning exhaust from next doors blow into the house. I would like to set it to 27 degrees / 80 degrees when I am home in the evening, but she wants me to just stick it out to save the electricity bill. This isn't ideal for me because I am constantly mildly sweating if I am not two feet away from a fan. Then I suggested that I buy a window ac unit just to keep my room cool and she says that's being selfish. Is my only option to move out or is there a diplomatic solution? Tldr; disagreement over a/c use. Is there a diplomatic solution?
I'm not going to tell the full story, but if someone wants me to I wouldn't be opposed. I went to a relative's house over the summer a few years ago. The neighborhood didn't have a lot of people around my age at the time. I met a girl while just walking around and we became friends. We kissed on the fourth of July because I had seen it in the movies and went for it. A few days before I had to leave we had one final day together. We had dinner and it was time to say goodbye. One final conversation outside talking and laughing about all that happened over the summer. One final kiss and goodbye and I never saw her again. It still hurts even a few years later. I'm sorry for this awful formatting. Sometimes the best thing you can do for the one you love is to say goodbye.
Well, this is my first post here, so, if this sub isn't for what I think it is please tell me. I have anger rages against my family, a lot, not someone in particular, against my mom, dad, brother and sister sometimes. My mood changes drastically after only one question and it keeps that way for a while (2 or 3 hours), it doesn't matter if I'm on a good mood or I'm having the best day of my life, if a family member asks me something about my job, school or relationship I instantly go into some mad man tone and start yelling at them. I don't why this happens only with them. Doesn't happen with friends, only with my siblings and parents. Somebody please give me some advice on how to manage my anger, and how to evade those situations. Pd. I talked with everybody alone and politely told them I have this problem, everybody except my mom told me to stop being ridiculous.
As a south Asian growing up in Canada was different, had to adjust to the new culture and had to balance a life with two different cultures. One at home and one outside of home. Parents never understood the culture clash we had to go threw growing up. They always imposed we should always prioritize our culture first. What really bothers me, is that they don't understand the need for us to try to blend in the majority culture at school. We don't want to be the outcast, we don't to be hated or bullied on. So we no choice but to live a double life. Something else that drives me crazy about south Asian parents (or maybe only mine), they always taught us how "white people" are racist toward us. They dislike us, for the food we eat, for the way we live our life and because we invaded "their country". AS growing up I always believed it, that white people isn't our friend, they wouldn't want the best for us. So always tried to make other south Asian friends. BUT THEY NEVER REALIZED they were the biggest racist. Telling us who to hate, who to dislike, who to avoid and what not. Calling others racist? When yourself are racist as well? Denial was their talent. It angers me how people can easily call others racist but they are racist themselves.I'm not going to hate a race, or a religious group because I'm different. Just angry at my parents right now and had to let this out. I'm not going to hate a race, or a religious group because I'm
I have almost no motivation. I'm so depressed I don't see a point in anything. When I look around at people my age I see drunks who only care about partying and mocking people for being different. When I look at the world in general I see a hostile environment to everyone. I've tried talking to people, I've tried drugs, I've tried isolation, I've tried therapy, nothing helps. Everything has become white noise, and I might seem arrogant to all but it's just the way I am; which is not an excuse. I try as hard as I can to keep my emotions to myself, and be cold and uncaring. I've completely lost faith in humanity, and my own worth as a human being, which I barely see myself as anymore. This is just a desperate cry for attention, I realize that, and I can't rationalize it beyond the thought that maybe there are others who see this who have pulled themselves out of this state and can help me. I don't know what I can do.
I'm angry. I'm hurt. I'm broken. I miss him with every fiber of my being. You left me here to raise our children, the children that look just like you, alone. It's not fair. It's not fair to the kids. Our kids that we tried so hard for. You were in therapy and you still chose to tear yourself out of our lives. I'm looking for you and I can't see you ever again. I wish you'd haunt me. Visit me in my dreams every night. I only wanted you in my life and I've told you that. It's not fair that you took that away.
TW Violent thoughts. Hi guys, first post here. Some background: I've been dealing with anger for a very long time without ever having sought help. Over the past few years, my outbursts have gotten more and more violent; it went from pillow hitting to wall punching to assault. I live with my fiancée. She's the most wonderful woman in the world and I would do anything for her. She's very sweet, a bit frail, and absolutely terrified of me. I've punched walls and destroyed property (of my own) in front of her. I've never thrown anything at her, destroyed her things, or actually hit her (though an argument has escalated to me pushing her over once). I'm a lot larger than her and I could easily do a lot of damage. Hurting her is my worst nightmare, but I'm terrified of losing control. Sometimes I'll even envision myself choking her or hurting her when I'm pissed and it makes me feel better for a moment but then it makes me feel sick. I get so angry sometimes my vision goes red and white and adrenaline spikes through my body. Should I seek help before I accidentally hurt her? I don't want her to be afraid of me anymore and I hate imagining these awful things. tl;dr I have violent tendencies and I'm afraid of hurting my fiancée. Is it time to see a professional? Have you guys experienced this?
Hi guys, just found this forum and looks to be exactly what I've been looking for. I have bad anxiety and depression. Right now they're both messing me up. I have to travel to a different country tomorrow. It means getting up at 330am, driving 2.5 hours to an airport, then checking in bags, going through security, enduring the actual flight. Then I have to work when I arrive and it's going to be super stressful. I feel completely overwhelmed. I should be sleeping already but I can't face going to sleep (I've taken a couple of Xanax) because if I I'm going to wake up and have to face the day. I hate this so much. Feel like I'm not going to be able to get through this. Really can't talk to anybody about it. Feel like giving up, not travelling, just staying here, not working and just saying to hell with it.
This is her first Christmas since her divorce in May. Her kids will be with their father Christmas Eve/Christmas morning. We are going to be together Christmas Eve, doing our gift exchange/celebrating. I will leave Christmas morning around 6am to head to my ex-wife's house for Christmas morning celebrations with my children (and ex-wife). This only draws more attention to the fact that my girlfriend is alone Christmas morning. She has suggested to her ex-husband to do a combined Christmas morning but he is still too angry over their divorce to allow that to happen. So, since she has to go this one alone, I am looking for creative/thoughtful ideas of how to soften the loneliness she'll be feeling Christmas morning. "Over-celebrating" Christmas eve is a really bad idea - I'd hate to compound an already bad situation by leaving her hung over. ;) edit: not that it changes anything, I'm 43. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ --- tl;dr: Girlfriend dealing with the first lonely Christmas morning post-divorce. Since I can't be there, what can I do to ease the sadness/loneliness?
I've been dating this guy B for around a month now and when the topic of sex came up clearly told him that in order to feel comfortable having sex I would like him to get an STD test and provide the results. He agreed and said it would be no problem and that was that. He told me he went to the Dr last Friday and was waiting on results. Fast forward to last night I ask him if he got the all clear and he said he got a call yesterday and he's clean. I decided to trust him and went ahead and slept with him without seeing the results. After we were done I got a weird feeling and asked him again, apparently he hasn't gotten the results back, and after some trickle truthing it turns out he hasn't even been tested just got the lab order from the Dr. I freaked out and he assured me that he got tested last year and hasn't had any sexual contact since. He went and got tested this morning by my request but I feel betrayed and lied to. If I would've known the truth I would've never slept with him. Just need other people's thoughts Thanks! Tl;dr Guy I've been dating lied to me about getting an STD test to get me into bed
Hello, this is the first time on this subreddit and I'd like to let you know that it's 1:20am and I'm freaking about my health again. Sorry for being graphic but I just went for a poop and it was really dark, hard to tell if it was black or dark brown. I immediately started panicking, cancer and everything like that and started googling about foods that cause it. I seen a few people say that chocolate cake causes dark stool so I start thinking. Sure enough recently I've consumed a lot of chocolate. I got greedy 2 days ago and ate an entire pack of oreos (don't judge) and last night I ate at an all you can eat restaurant. There I ate savory pancakes, chips, cheese balls, pizza, chocolate cake, cheesecake, chocolate raisins and chocolate eggs and sweets. Probably not the healthiest but I wanted to go all out, I rarely eat out. So now the big one, does any of the foods cause dark stool including the oreos. Much appreciated if you would answer
Ok. I just need to vent, so I'll get right into it. I have stage 4 endometriosis. I have terrible endo attacks that leave me feeling extremely drained and miserable once they've subsided. Well, I had one tonight and it was AWFUL. It's finally dulled back down to it's normal ache, but I feel pretty ragged physically and mentally. After it was over, I told my husband that I was hungry and asked him if he would go to my favorite fast food restaurant. He agreed. He asked me what I wanted and I told him I needed a few minutes to think about it because I still didn't feel right. He got back on his video game. ( I dont have a problem with gaming. I enjoy gaming myself ) After a while, he gets up to go do something and comes back in the room. He tells me that since I don't know what I want, he would just take me out tomorrow. I didn't get nasty with him, I just agreed and let it go, even though it kind of put me out. Here comes the part that got me so... upset. He left again and came back WITH FOOD, sat down and ate it infront of me. Come on man! Really?! I'm not trying to be a brat. I haven't said anything ugly to him... but damn, that got me so angry. I'm so damn tapped out right now, I wish I had the energy to go make something or go get something myself. I feel really selfish and dramatic and emotional because I don't feel good and I don't want to take it out on him. But man that was mean.
I need help. I'm struggling to live with an wait of 20months. Me and my girlfriend are going to move to another country, but the problem is that it's only going to happen only at December 2020. I'm already a very anxious person, I cannot even start to think about everything.. I need to concentrate in not to freak out. And yeah I know I have 20 months but...I can't stop to think about it, and it's making me crazy. -find a house (is the flatmates going to like me??) -find a job, make a cv -buy waterproof clothes cuz Ireland rains as f$#& - need to pack everything -and make a list of what to pack - am I forgetting something? -dude I still.have 597 days to my travel -and my dog??? Holy $#&# my dog Anyway, you understand what I've been into. My life turned in madness guys, I can only think and talk about this and it's starting to create troubles. I'm actually suffering with insomnia due to overthinking Thanks. Lucas
Before you guys jump down my throat... I'm not homophobic. I love my son and I'm happy he trusted us enough to inform us about his life and that he knows what he wants out of life. That being said I'm... well surprised I guess for a lot of reasons. When he came out to us my husband was quiet (I worried he was upset) but he just sort of nodded his head and said he wasn't too surprised. We ended our conversation and that was that. But earlier tonight I pushed my husband about what he meant and he confided in me that especially when he was younger he "saw the appeal of men" and then just laughed it off. WTH!? 20 years of marriage and he never thought it worth mentioning? Then he went on to say that when "we sent (son) off to college he figured he'd experiment if he hadn't already, and that maybe he'd inherited 'it' from him" and then kissed me, rolled over, and went to sleep. What am I supposed to do with this info? How can he drop a bombshell and then fall asleep!! >:( I don't see my boys any differently but I just feel so in the dark. **tl:dr:** Son comes out as gay, husband comes out as bi within 48 hours. I'm confused and don't know what to do..
I wanna know people cared about her. Her obit page has only 3 lit virtual candles. It's not a popularity thing. It's a "she was still good inside" thing. What happened is now all over the news and they don't have half the information correct. It's killing me. I can't escape. I lost my Nikki 2 years ago and now my Ladybug Libby. My past and future decimated. Just like that. It was all blinked out. There's still a question as to who killed her or if it was an accident. I doubt I will ever know. She called me that morning. I was asleep. When I got up I had an appt and it didn't go well. I saw she called. I got calmed down ate something and laid back down. WTH was I thinking? Why did I not call her back? I deserved to suffer. She didn't though. She should still be here. I tried to tell her she was worth so much more than what she was doing. I couldn't help her. I did try but I guess not hard enough.
Content warning: \*Violent verbiage I'm dealing with - or, I'll be frank - watching complacently as other people are dealing with my anger issues. Considering I'm very short on funds and can't afford most forms of proper weekly therapy, it's come to my attention that I should seek help *wherever* I can get it. This is definitely not my only plan of attack\* (told you) for controlling myself, but I'm wondering how many people here feel that being in this group helps them. Apologies for any perceived snide-ness - this is how I maintain. Also, has it been remarked upon yet that the "tab" when posting in r/Anger is "Submit to Anger"?
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me. I'm actually the worst girlfriend in the world and I feel like I have no control over it. I have this AMAZING man that I've been with for 1 year. We both got out of horrible marriages and were good friends before we got together. I absolutely love him, I can't imagine ever living without him. We get along great, fantastic sex, he's amazing with my child. I can't stop flirting with other men. I've done it in my first marriage and now in this new relationship Its like the second I get the vibe I can't help it. I know it's because I like the attention,I've been in a few very long term relationships so I've never really "dated". I'm currently flirting with a co-worker in another area of the country. Mostly by text...I don't even know why I do it. I have no interest in this other person, I have no intentions of ever physically cheating. I want to stop. I hate myself for it. I thought it was just because I was in a bad marriage before but I'm not now and I'm still at it. I know I'm probably just going to be bashed here but I'm looking for solid help. I want to stop this. **TL;DR: I have an amazing boyfriend and can't stop flirting with other men**
We’re having a Celebration of Life for my husband this Saturday, which is his birthday. He passed in February but I was 9 months pregnant and we decided to hold something in the summer instead. It felt like a good idea at the time and planning it has mostly been a good distraction but I’m starting to get anxious. Not knowing how it’ll go or how I’ll be. I have the urge to say something to the crowd since I know him best. I did prepare something short, it’s sweet and comical (just like him). Usually I get terrible anxiety public speaking but since his death I kinda have a fuck it attitude so maybe I’ll be ok? Has anyone experienced something similar and have advice?
Throwaway account because I think it would be really awkward if anyone I know finds this. I'm 19 and I have never had a girlfriend before. At age 12 I got into videogames (like REALLY into them) and basically spent all of my free time on my PC. I wasn't ever interested in a relationship and so I never asked anyone out or started dating. Then a year ago I started liking this girl. She didn't like me back and that's fine. My point is that I liked someone for the first time and now I do want to be in a relationship. Now the problem is that I never went out, I have no idea how to approach girls (the one mentioned earlier was a bit of a disaster) and I'm a bit awkward and I come off as insecure (which I kinda am). I don't drink and I really dislike going to parties. I have one actual hobby (running), so I don't know if I have many options for ways to meet a girl and asking them out (for which I also have no idea how to do that and not be awkward or creepy). Where do I go from here? I might be exhaggerating, but I'm a bit afraid I might end up alone. I'm 19 and I have 0 experience. Am I running out of time? I don't know what to do. tldr; Was never interested in relationships until recently. I have no experience talking to girls and I don't know where to start.
the person i trusted the most with every single fucking thing did the worst possible thing to me. i trusted this person with my life and they have crushed me into tiny little pieces and i know that the amount of regret they have can not compare to the amount of pain and suffering it has brought me. i feel like i am being eaten alive. i cannot confront them with what they have done because i want them to tell me. i want them to tell me straight up that they dont care about how i feel, and that they enjoyed what they did. i need to know the truth. the longer i wait for them the more defeated i feel. i absolutely cannot ask or even hint at it because it will destroy them too. they fucked up. they know it. i know it. they dont know that i already know. i want them to tell me. this person meant the world to me. was always there for me and i did the same. i hope that they will become strong enough to confront me. im angry. i want to make their life a living hell. taunt them and fuck them in the head. but that is just anger. i will wait. even if it will kill me. they dont deserve it.
i get so mad so fucking easily at the stupidest shit. i told some guy online to drink bleach because he said i suck a video game. ive told so many people on the internet to kill themselves, that they're morons, that they're worthless, over such stupid bullshit. and i cant stop myself from getting angry. there are just some things that i see and i get fucking instantly enraged and i just cant control what i say. ive been dealing with this for like 4 fucking years now and the amount of bad things ive said to innocent people is fucking ridiculous. i feel like such a fucking piece of shit. since 2013 ive probably told literally thousands of random people on reddit, video games, etc to end their lifes and fucking lashed out at them with incredibly ruthless language just because they may have said something extremely meaningless to me that made me mad in the moment. i dont even know what the point of this post is, i just wasnt able to post anything on /r/offmychest so i just posted this shit here. if karma is real then the amount of shit that i have coming my way is fucking gigantic. i feel like such a piece of shit when i realize how many people ive probably made feel like shit. mayve i even fucking broke the camel's back in a few cases and actually made people do it. im a fucking shit head, fuck!
The next month I've to do some exams which are very important to me because depending on the results I could access to the university I want to attend next year. The problem is that we have to be in a big classroom 30 min before the exam and then it lasts 2 hours. I have 7 exams in 3 days and they are probably the most important I will take for the moment. The problem is that usually when I get too nervous I feel the need to go to the bathroom because I can't resist the necesity. I would appreciate any advice or recommendation of you guys so I could beat the tests. Thank you in advice!
Warning! This is my worst nightmare come true and is a bit gross... So after dating this girl for 9 months and staying at her house numerous times, I finally worked up the ability to calm my toilet anxiety for long enough to go number 2 in her house. It only has one toilet. When I go to flush the bowl fills up with water. Having never used her toilet before I call out and ask if that’s normal for her toilet, with a level of panic in my voice and after 2 panic attacks already... She calls back “what do you mean, of course not!” So she comes to have a look. And as it’s the house her parents own, she ends up calling her mum. On video call. And her brother who is a plumber. And they all stare at everything in the toilet and spend a long time (over an hour) discussing what it’s likely to be. In the end it was a blockage from the water company in the back garden and nothing to do with me. Whoever next flushed that toilet would have had the same issue. It was just the worst possible timing! I’m still having panic attacks thinking about all this yesterday... she is already trying to laugh at it and make jokes... Tl;dr: used girlfriends toilet for the first time and it got blocked. Entire family looked at my business!
Alright this is kind of a weird one. My boyfriend’s been cheating on me for a bit online with literally anyone who will sext with him, he also hoards photos of nude women, including women who have clearly not consented to having their pics posted. he’s a sex addict I guess. I also love sex but for him it’s pathological. I’ve been holding off on breaking up with him for selfish reasons honestly, I’m living with him and his mom until I get back on my feet. I just signed a lease though and I’m pretty much independent again. I decided to snoop once more through his shit and on his “nsfw” google photos account his most recent pic is a zoomed in photo of his 18 year old sister topless in the bathroom, he took it through a crack in the door. Ew? I didn’t think it was this bad initially, but now I’m super grossed out and planning on breaking up with him as soon as I can get the rest of my stuff out of his room next week. I don’t know if I should tell her and her mom + possibly tear apart a family or just let them live blissfully unaware. I’m leaning towards telling her, but I don’t want to make the wrong decision here. Would appreciate advice, thank you. TLDR; bf is cheating, planning on breaking up, found out he took a creep shot of his sister, don’t know if i should tell her
I need to let this out. I've always been a private person. I enjoy having many friends, but very few close friends. It always takes so long for me to open up to people. The more people I let in, the more vulnerable I'll be. It's worse when it's with guys. When a guy friend becomes too close, and starts texting every single day just to ask how I'm doing, I'll automatically think of reasons why it won't work out and start to friendzone him. I did it unconsciously, and I only just realized I've been doing that recently. But I did fall in love once. He was a friend, and he somehow slipped past my defenses. Unfortunately, he only saw me as a friend. I've moved on, but it seems like no one else has ever managed to make me feel like that again. I always thought I'm a romantic. I grew up with fairy tales, and I WANT to fall in love. So I don't know why I keep pulling away from relationships. Maybe I am sick. I don't know how to stop running away. Tl;dr: I may have commitment phobia, how do I deal with it?
So my name is Ginny I dated this amazing guy back in March we broke up because he liked some other girl that didn’t like him back I kept liking him I still like him now and throughout the months he always got mad at me and blocked me but I always went back to him turns out he never stopped liking me either but now I like him a lot and I’ve been crying myself to sleep lately because it turns out he likes this other girl that doesn’t like him at all so I like him he likes her and she likes someone else and he said he won’t give up on her so I have no chance and I’m a solid 1/10 and she’s a 8/10 they are both so popular and I’m just a loner. Moral of the story Fuck love.
I’ve just moved to a new town and started a new job. The job is not my typical job that I’m used to. I usually work desk jobs however my new job is much more customer based and more of a roster then set times. I really wanted to do something different than a desk job so I applied for this job. However I’m not sure if it’s really the job for me. It’s only my 3rd day and I didn’t even get through the whole day because my grandmother passed away this morning and found out at work. They sent me home and said I have 2 days of brevement. As upset as I am about my grandmother, I’m also happy as she had lived for 106 years. She had a great life and she’s now at peace. As much as I want to take these 2 days I feel I’d be using them for the wrong reason, being that I’m not enjoying it and don’t really want to work there. I’m also feeling very, very homesick. I miss my old town and my old job. I have all these emotions and I’m not sure how to handle them. I don’t want to make any rash decisions whilst being so conflicted. Any advice or help will be much appreciated. Tldr; Grandmother passed away today, not enjoying my new job and feeling very homesick.
I love reading small success stories here, it gives me hope and is a reminder that anxiety can be overcome. Hopefully my experience gives you happy hopeful feels! After an extremely shitty month with a lot of setbacks, sick days off work, bad SH moments, and missed university classes I really wanted to pull out of this battle I registered for, but thankfully the shame of possibly being thought of as a quitter outweighed the shame of being terrible/freezing up. I know I have skills I have worked hard for, but I struggle to call on them while freestyling. I'm so terrified of making a fool of myself I don't commit to any moves and the whole dance looks like a timid mess. Last Monday I made a plan to practice in preparation. Tried a few steps in the mirror then broke down in tears because i looked so bad. I don't care about the win so much as the fact that, for the first time, I was able to compete and show off my actual capabilities. Everyone was quite shocked at how much i had "improved" when the only variable was my ability to stay calm when freestyling. Self harm can be a vicious cycle of low self esteem > harm > scars look awful and now you can't wear short sleeves > low self esteem > harm and so on. Break the cycle!! Keep working towards your goals, even in teensy weensy baby steps. One day you might just get a breakthrough
Got my first US at 6 weeks and measured 5+5, second US was at 8 weeks on Tuesday and still measured only 6w. Never heard a hearbeat. I'm preparing for an impending miscarriage, but I haven't had any signs yet physically that it's coming. Only some dissipation of pregnancy symptoms. My question is: when did you start to miscarry naturally from the time your baby stopped growing? I want to wait for it to happen naturally if possible, but the waiting is quite an emotionally taxing one. I think after my final US next week if it doesn't happen, my Dr may suggest pill/d&c. Thanks, and sorry to all who've experienced this ❤️
Together 8 years, married 5. Basically the title says it all. I can't tell him that something he did is bothering me without him saying I'm complaining. I can't express my hurt/disappointed feelings without him saying I'm exaggerating or I'm the one with the problem or getting mad at me. He asks why must I always complain about everything when he never does. And it's true. He forgives all my mistakes, he never gets mad at me unless I bring something up that he did and he gets defensive and then we fight. He says if I didn't complain we wouldn't fight. I guess my question is, is he right? Should I just swallow it up when I don't like something and not say anything? I feel like I should be able to express something is bothering me/I don't like it. Tl;dr If I didn't express displeasure with anything he says/does my husband and I would literally never fight. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone.
I feel like it's not real but it's not bad...I tried and gave it my all, I didn't end it so I don't feel like it's my fault. I changed for the better. I don't think I could things differently..if I did I feel like I'd be unhappy with myself and hate my future..I wish she would have been supportive of me...well I don't blame anyone. I could have done things differently but I didn't. I failed. I'm just at a point in life where I have been planning for two people and suddenly it's just me. I got people around me keeping me company. I saw things differently I guess...and now I just worry about sleep, can I sleep? I wonder...I know I can manage but it's just doesn't feel real. I guess I'm not what she wanted after all these years...
A couple months ago I was dating a girl I had a crush on for about three years, it turned out she was dating somebody 8 years older, who they started dating when she was underage. He visited her multiple times while I "dated" her, and she even slept over at his hotel. She maintains they never had sex but I'm not stupid Now she's in college, still with the old guy, making like twenty new friends, has a new "bf" on the side. Meanwhile I'm all alone, I have like two close friends, but they're not that close, I have another year of high school with people I'm not that great friends with. I just hate how she lied to me and now she's winning.
I have fully impacted wisdom teeth and the plan was to get them out this summer, before I go back to school and before there is any kind of issue. The problem is that the insurance clearance never came back so I haven't been able to have them removed yet. Well today I woke up from a nap and the far right side of my lower jaw is causing me very intense pain. I have a very high pain tolerance, but there is definitely something wrong. I've taken 3 motrin and it is still throbbing and making me want to just take it out myself. The right side of my face is even swollen. I'm just really struggling because I have work every day this week starting tomorrow, and it is my last week before I go back to school. I also don't know if I can even wait for tomorrow when my dentist is open so I can go see them, but at the same time, I don't know if I really want to go to the emergency room, because I just feel stupid every time I go. No matter what I think of, it's just making me more and more anxious.
Hello, I apologize if this isn't the place to put this post. I'm new to reddit. Anyways, I play fighting games competitively. I'm very good at them and go to tournaments. I LOVE video games. But the problem is I get super heated. I don't throw my controller or anything. Instead I take my anger out with yelling and saying vulgar shit. I don't want to go in depth on what i say for obvious reasons lol. I want to know how you guys cope with your anger? I was never diagnosed with any anger problems which REALLY surprises me, because I can get angry pretty easily. I'm not sure if this matters, but I'm saying it anyway just in case: I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and it's really holding me back from every day things.
My anxiety has been improving remarkably over the past few months, however I still feel terrified over going to the dentist. I had my wisdom teeth out a couple of years ago over several different appointments, however I did not enjoy the heavy sedation feeling from the tablets they ave me for the procedure. I have not had any dental work completed for a long time, however months ago I was told that I needed a molar removed since it is broken. Last night I chipped another tooth, and so I need to get to the dentist to fix this and prevent any further damage. &#x200B; I am terrified of the anesthetic they use at the dentist since it makes me feel like I am choking. I am also worried about what the Dentist might say about my other teeth, like if they all need to be extracted and replaced. Most of my teeth seem fine however. The Dentist offers to put patients under during the procedure, but that scares me more than anything else. They also offer sedatives which made me feel way too loopy last time, and laughing gas tends to give me a headache. Does anyone have any tips for this type of anxiety? I have my own PRN anxiety meds, but it is not very strong and at a tiny dose.
Firstly, I want to mention that I know that I fucked up. I told my girlfriend that my ex (1 year relationship 3 years ago) enjoyed oral sex by me. We were having some problems in the bedroom, and I mentioned that I could perform oral sex to please her and mentioned that my ex enjoyed it. I had a really bad break-up with my ex and have since moved on. I shouldn't have done this, but I have a tendency to blurt out stuff without thinking about it. I realised immediately that this has no bearing with our relationship. Now she cant stop thinking about it and she is saying that its the last straw. I really love this person and I feel that she is the one for me. I am at a loss about how to fix this. I am totally drawing a blank. She thinks I am still hung up about m ex cause I mentioned this. I want some advice. TL,DR - Mentioned that my ex used to enjoy oral sex with me to my current girlfriend and she thinks thats cause I am hung up on her.
It might be the stress. I have a pretty major surgery in five days, and three finals I need to complete before then (all of which I haven't worked on yet). While I'm recovering, I'm going to be working three different jobs, but I think I'm going to be okay. I was fine this morning. Then, in the afternoon, I kind of snapped. Now everything's making me angry. It's been four hours and I haven't felt anything but anger and sadness. I don't know what to do. edit: Just saw the FAQ, made me want to laugh and cry at the same time. Sleep isn't an option at this university, it's nearly impossible to get healthy food here without busting your wallet, and I can't exercise because I'm in a brace and will be on crutches soon.
I honestly don’t even really have anything else to say. Since she passed away it just feels like the world is a very, very scary and unfamiliar place. I have no refuge, no one who cares about me or loves me unconditionally. She lit up everyone’s life with her unending supply of compassion and love. She saw everyone and made everyone feel so loved and special. She called me her baby even tho i am in my thirties and always checked on me, even tho she was dying. I did not deserve her. I didn’t appreciate what an amazing person she was and i feel like the rest of life is not worth living when i think about how i won’t ever get answers to questions i have for her again, i won’t ever get a text from her or phone call. She was the only person to reach out. Until she couldn’t anymore. I am just a black hole inside. My life is absolutely meaningless without her.
i’ve chosen to spend today alone, and it’s been really nice. the first three anniversaries of her death, i had get-togethers with more of a celebratory feel because she had wanted kind of a party for her funeral, and at the time, i just couldn’t make that party vibe happen, ya know? and then last year i actually attended riot fest because the year she died my sister and i actually had to leave riot fest to go to her bedside because she fell into a coma. but this year, it felt right to be alone and journal about her. i took a long bike ride. it feels good. other people being involved in grieving can sometimes tarnish it. that’s all. i feel peace. and damn it i miss her laugh SO much!
Sooo it's my first reddit post, unfortunately not an awesome one... To begin, I have a wonderful relationship with my fiance but i have 0 friends. This September i've started university in new city and i've moved in with my ex best friend (we were close in high school) but the thing is that we just live in the same room, we almost never talk and if we talk, we talk about uni or home duties. It just faded away... We both have changed and now we're just roommates. She was my only friend left after our group of few friends just got smaller and smaller every year. I do know some acquaintances, classmates, fiance's friends but no friends and to make things even worse my fiance lives in my hometown and is going to a military service this December. So yeah seeing ,how everyone is having great time with their new or old friends , making me think I'm boring and shit as i do not drink alcohol or smoke ( as it seems like it's the only way students get friends). Does anyone want to talk to me? ( ╯︿╰ )
I got to hold a snake a while back it was friendly really friendly. Idk how but I started scrolling through photos and found a photo of the snake with me and I thought about that day and it reminded me of my old cat Mila I got her as a kitten as a gift from my moms friend, as I couldn’t have her at are house but we where moving I had her with a babysitter who got rid of her i miss her why it reminded me of her was the snake seemed to like my hoodie and like to lay in my hood so I just let it stay there, Mila used to like to cuddle me well she would be in my hoodie not my hood but still my hoodie. I miss her deeply and I love snakes Idk if I’ll get another kitten but ig I’ll see.
My bass player in my band parted ways. We mutually agreed, etc, blah blah blah. However, when I sit with him at lunch, he puts me and my music down and has an implied belief that his music is better than mine because it is more complex and new. Yesterday, I told him how I showed my dad (who was a drummer in a band that covered popular rock and blues songs that did ok for itself) the music he likes and how my dad didn't like it. He then proceeds to say how my dad has no right to say anything because he was never successful with it. Several times this past month I have felt the urge to smash him in the mouth; he's always made fun of me and my music. He did the same things to our drummer, almost causing several fights to break out. He seems to enjoy making people angry. What I'm going to do is start slowly phasing him out of my life, because obviously he isn't a real friend. Rant over.
I've always had an explosive temper since I was a little kid and would often chase my siblings with knives, break down doors to get to my sibling that was hiding from me, and even one time chase my sister with a running chainsaw.... As I grew up, I realized how messed up all of that stuff was but even now I can't control my anger. I've tried all the usual stuff to control my anger such as, counting, meditation, therapy, and a lot of other things and none of it seems to work. Im trying to build a life with my SO now but my anger keeps getting in the way and im scared they are going to leave me because of it. I do want to clarify that i've never mentally, verbally, or physically abused my partner and would never even think about that but I do have regular meltdowns and im scared that one day im going to do something I regret. I just don't know what to do anymore and I want help so bad but I don't know what to do.
Sometimes I feel like theres something wrong with me that I can't see. People get defensive of me when buddies make fun of me like I'm... like... challenged? Is it because they think something's wrong with me? I dont know. It causes me a lot of worry when I'm with people. I'm also worried people can read my thoughts? I know its fucking insane but I have really gross and weird intrusive thoughts that make me intensely self conscious. I've already gotten therapy for depression and it was the most embarrassing experience because for some reason my mom overshared my problems to a lot of the family and my friends also told people and so did my school counselor (she told my teachers to try to "help"). I know this is spiralling towards larger problems and I need help but I really need my family not to know about it because the worst thing for me is people treating me like I have a handicap. Edit: stop being a dick. You know who you are. I'm trying to get advice from anyone but the fucking joker.
I have noticed that my frustration with my grandma has been growing recently. Just exchanging a couple of words with her makes me very agitated and immediately puts me in a bad mood. I would love to work on this as it is currently the biggest source of negativity for me. I am aware that there is something I need to forgive her or myself for, but the issue is I don't know what it is. I don't know what the underlying cause for all of this anger towards her is and I feel like that's really holding me back from moving on. I'm not sure how to deal with it while not knowing what exactly is my issue with her. I would like some guidance because living with her and having to go through this every day a couple of times is exhausting.
I’ll summarize this. I have been diagnose with depression and anxiety before by a psychiatrist and I have been able to manage it or keep it under control most of the time. However, lately, I have been so angry and I don’t know why. I don’t know if I’m angry at myself or at someone or something. I found out a couple of days earlier that I was cheated and lie to by someone who I thought was special to me. However, I don’t hate her or anything I just accepted the fact that she wasn’t the one for me and I deserve better. I don’t know what is wrong with me or why am I so angry. What do you guys think it might be? Do you think it’s anger toward myself or toward someone or something? Thank you in advance.
Usually I get furious over nothing, but what is at least just as frustrating is when I can't feel any anger over something that I want and should feel anger about. Ever had that too? Yesterday, out of the blue, I got the news that I'm being discharged from my therapy (anxiety, not anger). It doesn't make sense (yet) and the reasons they gave were very vague. I'm in the middle of a difficult period (conflicts at a new job) for crying out loud. I was even forced to pick my own ending date, which I refused (causing anger with them). The thing is, I've had some run-ins with one of the lead therapists. I tend to question things, and sometimes turn out to be right, which doesn't amuse her at all. This is really the only logical explanation I can find for my sudden discharge. Now, this should make me feel angry. The whole situation, being wronged, lack of power, etc, should and would usually make me angry. I **want** to be angry. But I feel nothing. If anything I feel a slight excitement. I just don't get it! This is the time to feel anger, and now it's not there! I feel more anger about anger not being there. And what scares me about this is that it might come at another moment, triggered by something completely random.
I don't know where else I can ask this. I'm having trouble to concentrate on some tasks that I have to do. I'm a literature student and there are lots of texts I need to read every week. I usually enjoy reading so much, and I even write myself and want to pursue a career of writing. But when this anxiety hits I can't do anything, I just waste my time on stupid things like browsing on the internet mindlessly and arguing with random people. The process is like that: I sit on my chair, open the book I'm reading and after a few sentences I just get excited by the text so much that I stop reading and my mind starts to shift to something else. Then I just get my phone in my hand and start browsing. Two or three hours pass and I only read two pages. Not being able to read makes me even more anxious and usually I have a headache at the end of the day. I hate myself. I'm wasting my time and I'm not even enjoying that time, it definitely doesn't involve any kind of joy. Have you ever experienced something like that? How do you cope with it?
I feel robbed, like a victim. I am NOT a victim, but I feel like I'm being treated like one. Some bad shit has happened to me in the past--getting raped, being homeless--and I didn't have any family and close ones to call on for help outside from my parents. All my so-called friends were unable to help me. I use video games as an escape method, and even there I get picked on, disrespected and treated like shit. They created lies about me and made a reputation that I'm this awful and bad person, and it's all a bunch of fucking lies, I tell you. They're fucking ASSHOLES. I HATE THIS POSITION I AM IN LIFE, and it feels like there's NOTHING I can do to change it. I wish I could be more coherent and more detailed with the things I am saying, but honestly, I feel like a tortured soul. I have my flaws, but I'm not an asshole, unless you are one to me. "Treat others how you want to be treated," right? Apparently fucking not. I have nothing. No money, no car, no job, no fucking reason to live. I'm 25 years old, and I feel suicidal. I want help but I know I am not getting it. That makes me SO FUCKING ANGRY. I HATE EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW. THIS IS SUCH BULLSHIT.
My uncle passed away last year unexpectedly leaving behind a young daughter and my aunt (through marriage) and her dad passed away shortly after my uncle unexpectedly, so to say the least the last year for her has been awful not to mention she wasn’t able to work for 3 months and now is out of work again until who knows :( I know with the major holidays coming around it’s going to be hard for her as it is for all of us and I want her to know that I’m here for her, I have never lost a spouse or ever experienced a loss in my family until he passed away. Sometimes I will type up something that I think would be comforting to hear but then I overthink it and end up deleting it all because I don’t want to say something that may trigger/upset her without knowing that I said something to even do that! So I’m looking for some advice on some ideas to reach out to her. I talk to her about once a week usually anyways so texting her isn’t going to out of the blue either!
I go to therapy. I take medication. I've done both if these things for a long time. So then why is my first thought in the morning still always "I wish O was fucking dead"? This would all be so much easier if the people around me would just let me do what needs to be done. I mean, at this point, it's the only solution that will produce a long-lasting good for me. My entire future, even the good parts, will be marred by pain, so I should really just be put down like an old dog. But instead I'm being kept around for the pleasure and convenience of others, which is understandable, I mean I don't want anyone I love to die, so why should others be any different? But still, it just feels unfair somehow. Yes, my death would cause pain in others, but I'm in pain all the time. If I die, people will move on without me, but if I live, I will have to endure life until I can't possibly live anymore. Idk what my point is here. Just venting I suppose. If anyone wants to either try and help or finally push me over the edge, I would greatly appreciate it.
DAE get panic attack like symptoms right when you're about to fall asleep? Like, for no reason. I'll be seconds away from falling asleep or have just fallen asleep and I'll jump awake with increased rate of breathing, a sense of panic, and a loss of feeling/control of my arms/legs. Once this starts, it is a continuous loop of falling asleep for maybe a minute and then jumping awake again. It goes on for about an hour probably. I normally have to wake up at 4AM or 5AM for work so staying up for a while once it starts happening is not an option. It doesn't happen all the time, maybe once every week/ every other week or so. Last night was particularly bad which is what prompted me to write this. I repeatedly woke up panicking because my limbs felt really weird, I could hardly control them for the first 10 seconds or so after becoming alert. The feeling is incredibly unnerving. I'm not convinced it's sleep paralysis although nothing else really sounds like it.
My aunt is a Cambodian refugee who has been living in Canada for about 30 years. She has been working at Dollarama for 11 years and today she quit her job. Regular customers know her there and she genuinely enjoyed her job. Because of everything that is happening in the world, some morally degenerate people decided it was okay to make racist remarks towards her. She was already working without protective equipment, was under high stress due to lack of employees, and was just trying her best. A customer told her that her people were infecting the world (referring to the spread of COVID 19. Not only is that just blatantly incorrect but a disgusting thing to say to anyone. She left for the staff room crying and after she calmed down a little bit, her manager asked her to come back to work. She went. A similar thing was said to her **again** and the manager did nothing and asked her to continue working. She ended up crying again and had to quit. Seeing her this upset breaks my heart and she continues to feel awfully. This is the same woman that invited a 20 somthing-year-old nigerian international student for Christmas brunch at her house because he had no family to spend the holidays with. I'm just so sad that this happened and continues to happen to people.
It has been well over five years now since I was in a meaningful relationship. I'm not a virgin, I've been with a number of girls (Nine. Honestly. There.) The trouble is I have a particular fetish. Now, a couple of these young women indulged me. Ultimately, however, a void remained. I happened to find God, if you will, following the dissolution of that most recent affair and ever since then I've struggled with the hopelessness of life itself given the faith that my true happiness is simply impossible on the face of this earth. ...In other words, due to the spiritual conflict within I can no longer even futilely pursue the affection I so desperately desire. Ironically, my prayer life has ceased due to the underlying sincerity that I'd rather die in my sleep than "live" another day in this world. ...That's it in a nutshell. Others have it worse, of course, but emotionally I'm starving in a desert like any other ForeverAlone-er. ...I don't see myself returning to my old mindset in the approach of love and yet...that's the single greatest reason to have life, to love and be loved on that most intimate level. ...Don't get me started on the random shootings, the economy, and generally the suffering of humanity around the globe that dampens the spirit regardless of how closely we may ever be affected by any of it. ...In conclusion, suicide is by no means an option though it crosses my mind on a daily basis. I enjoy many things about everyday life...but it is that central emptiness that suffocates my drive to give a fuck the way I once did. Maybe eventually it'll invert itself like some black hole and annihilate the guilt preventing my happiness. : )
My husband just passed away Nov 23rd this year and I've had a hard as hell time lately. Glad to be almost done with the holidays - but New Year's will be hard as we always celebrated with our nieces (his only sibling/ sister's kids, 10 and 14) and our son - 7 years old now. I'm an only child and my parents are basically adult children. Friends have been scarce the last couple years as he got sicker. I've tried befriending my sister in law and her husband but for whatever reason she thinks the husband and I have been flirting when honestly just getting to know more about each other and finding out we have a lot in common - never really hung out around each other as he is kind of a loner himself, doesnt come to family functions. I try hanging out with just her or the kids but they have all been distant. Lonely as heck over here and having trouble managing my adhd kiddo through Christmas break by myself. Sorry for the shit post, just kind of venting, don't really have anywhere else at the moment to share. Thanks for reading if you got this far.
For context we have been together approx 6 years. For the first 4 years sex was often and great! Now however it has became a rarity and I think as low as 5-6 times this year... For me sex isn't a massive thing overall but it is still a part of a bigger picture. I feel when it becomes as rare as this something may be wrong. it's something I'd like to address before it drives a wedge between us so I'm asking for advice or guidance on how to approach this situation. My SO rarely feels in the mood recently and try to talk to her about it but she gets dismissive and tries her best to drop the conversation. I'm a 24M and she's 25. This situation is made much more difficult by the fact during normal daily life she has not changed a bit still full of energy and bubbly, the exact same girl if fell in love with. Not really sure the best way to tackle this situation. Tl;Dr even though everything else is fine i'm experiencing a sex lul in my relationship and needed advice.
Last friday me and my friend were out partying and we had a blast. Untill the girl whom he has been inlove with for like 1 year arrived to the party. You see we are all classmates since 3 years back and he started develop feelings for her. And since then he has had very bad evenings when they invole alcohol and we are form sweden and when we drink we drink alot, especially when we are feeling down. Well now to the story; He started puking and crying so me and a couple of friends joined him in the bathroom and talked with him. It got really emotional and he cried even more. He told us he could not focus whilst in class and his grades have been fucked due to that. He said he was really depressed cuz he could not stop thinking about her (she has a boyfriend). I started crying aswell because i felt his pain and I could relate. What do you guys think he should do?? He really wants to talk to her, and i think he should. What would you recomend that he should do??????
One day, mom came home with a kitten. We named him Charlie. Charlie was about as malnourished as you could get. You could easily feel his spine and ribs when petting him. He had a permanent grumpy look about him, but was perhaps the cuddliest cat I know. We have around seven other cats, all of them living outside. So, the blocks slid into place in seemingly everyone's head but mine that Charlie should be an outside cat as well. Two problems, though. One, we live in the woods, and two, HE IS SMALL AND STARVING I woke up one morning. Charlie was gone. He hasn't come back, and it's been over two months. On one hand, I feel responsible because I didn't suggest that Charlie should be an inside cat until he was big enough to fight more than my finger. On the other, I feel everyone else is responsible, as they thought it was fine to let him roam free so close to the woods. It also seems like nobody really cared after a week. I'm still upset about Charlie disappearing. I'd still hope that he'd come back, but there's no chance of that happening.
Our relationship has been pretty rocky at the start. I asked her to marry me. There were definitely a lot of things that the marriage fixed. but at the same time opened up a lot of different problems. We haven't been married long (~6 months). Many of the issues apparent in our relationship prior to the marriage seem to have intensified and gotten worse. Sometimes I wish I never got married. I feel tied down. I'd like to some guidance. I love my wife. I'm just not sure that we were supposed to be married. There were a lot of red flags. --- **tl;dr**: I married my partner. My life feels restricted and limited now and I don't know how to approach determining whether this is good for both of us.
I had a very angry father, who gave me an example at a young age to be quick to anger, and be violent and hot headed. It is very much like a disability, as that is all I know how to do. It makes me feel very powerless. I at least need a way to make my fuse longer, because right now it is VERY short. I get mad at mundane things and become irrationally angry. I remember fights I got into many months ago and still get mad about them, and become very violent. I just want to at least have a longer fuse so I don't keep saying and doing things that I regret later.
I’ve been feeling super stressed and emotional since August. My boyfriend moved to a different city for a job and is super busy all the time which causes me to feel neglected because I feel he makes time for everyone but me sometimes. I am a senior in undergrad and applying to graduate schools and feel that I’m not good enough to get in. On top of that I have my classes and various stuff for those. I’ve tried talking to my boyfriend and parents but no one gets it and I don’t know where to turn next. These feelings have been messing with my relationships and health and if anyone could offer some advice I’d greatly appreciate anything.
My gf is sad all the time, like I get it, I'm depressed myself so I kinda know like, I have tried suicide 12 times as I have counted, and even so I am so happy to see her everyday, but it's like, she lives 11 hours away from me, and I'm going to move up to her after I've turned 15, in summer, and that is because she's the love of my life and I just want her, she's the only reason I'm still alive, but it hurts me to see how shes sitting up every night crying, she even admitted that not even I, cant make her stop, she agreed on that I cannot make her happy, and it just feels like she doesn't love me as much as I love her, this is my first time getting something off mye chest like fr. but I hope it maybe can give me some motivasion. But it's like, I'm going to risk my hole carrier just to move to her, to be with her, but it feels like she doesn't even love me as much as she says and that's why I always sit till 5 am. I don't know what to do anymore.
Okay I’m late on this, but after rewatching clips I have to get this out I am 18 years old, I have two little brothers. One is 8 and the other is 5. Bill from IT also has an 8 year old brother, and the new movie shows his arm getting torn off as he cries in pain and screams for his older brother. This is too sad for me, I keep imagining this happening to my little brothers when I watch it, and I’m tearing up as I type this He’s an innocent little kid wtf my heart can’t take it, and he dies painfully! And plus if you read up about a little, Pennywise actually takes his victims’ souls too and torments them, so while he fucks with Bill’s head pretending to be George, his actual soul is trapped in the deadlights in literal hell, a fucking paper boat loving 8 year old! Who had no bad bone in him! And he’s gone ;-; *iT’s JuSt A mOvIe FuCk oFf WiTh ThIs EmOtiOnaL sHiT* No, I have little brothers so I’m allowed to be torn over this. You wouldn’t know what it feels like to watch that if you were me, imagine how painful this was for a little kid. I’m messed up over this, movie or not I still watched that happen with realistic effects Don’t get me wrong though, Jackson’s acting was great The movie was well done, maybe just too well done Really powerful tone that puts me in Bill's point of view
A couple of weeks ago I sent a screenshot of a girl I know Instagram post to a friend (we're both guys, 20) The conversation was "I know bro, I know.." - friend, "that's like stop scrolling, zoom in shit" - me, then friend sent a unrelated meme. So anyway fast forward a week or so and I'm currently working out of town. My girlfriend is at home and went to use my computer to get some movies. I had left Facebook open and she has stumbled across these messages. So she text me saying 'you like girl x' and I'm not sure what's going on but eventually found out what's happened. I apologize but she said she doesn't trust me and I'm only apologizing because I was caught. I sent her a text this morning saying I love her and I don't want to lose her but she hasn't replied. What can I do to apologize properly and regain her trust? **Tl:dr** Girlfriend caught me talking to a mate about another girls Instagram. (been going out for a year and leaving together for 10 months, happy before this. She's 18, I'm 20)
i have spent a year in europe, and just came home several weeks ago. I was a rotary exchange student. I had the best year, and miss my life. Not a thing or person or culture, just the reality I had. Now I am back at my high school for a fifth year, and most of my closest friends have left. I live in a horrible small town in the states, and don't want to be here. all I want to do go back to my old life. but i know i cant. so i just want to talk about my experiences and relive them. I feel like a homeless person trying to push their old stories on people. I haven't done it yet, but the inability to release the feelings from my exchange is really difficult. Any words or thoughts would be nice. I need to stop feeling sorry for myself but because no one near me is going through what I am, it's more difficult. I feel very alone, and just want to be selfish and cry in my room. PS I don't know how reddit works. PPS I fucking hate being back. even more than the mulleted sexists that are my fellow countrymen
I am a low libido woman and for almost our whole relationship (10 years), my husband has also been low libido. We had sex occasionally and it was perfect. Plenty of nonsexual cuddling as well. I have a calm, sedate energy and he matched that. Well, in the last few months or something he's changed a lot. He wants way more sex, it feels like he's constantly initiating, groping, a couple times even begging. I'm so confused. It's gotten to the point where I don't even want to sit close to him on the couch because he's going to try to put moves on me and I just don't want that. I've asked him what's changed and he's not sure, he just has way more of a sex drive lately, which is weird because we're in our 30s now and sex drive typically goes down with age. I try to be kind in my refusals. Sometimes I go along with it but I'd really rather not most of the time. I've encouraged him to masturbate with porn or something but he claims he doesn't want that. Honestly it doesn't really feel like he wants me either, just female flesh and I'm the source of it nearby. I don't think it's testosterone supplements, I have seen him working out, could be some sort of online relationship but I have no proof. What do I do? --- **tl;dr**: formerly low libido husband now wants sex all the time
There's one dude that continuously picks on my friends group, me especially, trying to be funny. I'm doing internship, and I'll be stuck with this guy for 2 months, we're on our 3rd day and I already can't stand him anymore. I'm ashamed to admit I have a history of violent backlashes to this type of stuff ( risked being kicked out multiple times back in high school ), but that happened when I was young, I'm grown now, I don't want it to happen again. I don't wanna hurt this guy, especially since I'm in nursing school and I should be helping people, not the opposite. After a long afternoon of thinking, I really can't think of a scenario where I wouldn't lose my cool, so I'm asking here, hoping for some help Thanks in advance, it might sound stupid, but means a lot to me, I really don't wanna resort to violence ever again in my life
Hey everyone, so i'm with my girlfriend for soon 4 years, and the major problem of our relationship is that she absolutely HATE sex, and I can't live without it. I don't know if that's a problem of me but I love sex, not ashame of saying it, but because she hate it we only have sex about twice per month, and that just destroy me, everytime she say "No, not tonight" I feel angry, I feel bad, I feel live i'm just feeling like a weird perv and she's my "victim", everytime we have sexe, I feel horrible, I feel like what i'm doing is wrong, and that feeling is just eating me alive. When we were together, for the first 4 month, we had a lot of sexe, and right after thoses 4 month, it was no sex for more than a year and a half. So I don't know what I should do, now we live together, I love her, but that problem is just too hard to handle, I really don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to end our relationship "just for sex", but as I said, for me it's important And BTW : I already talk to her, and she said she won't made any effort for that. tl;dr: GF hate sex, but I love it EDIT : Still looking for advice, so if you come here and wanna help, you can :)
I'm 23. I've always suffered from some mild form of anxiety but it never got bad until I went to college where I also acquired depression. I went to college for 2 years straight out of high school because that's what everyone else did, and I dropped out for financial and obviously, medical reasons. I didn't want to continue and waste money when I had no idea what I wanted to major in, plus I wanted to take care of my mental health. After 2 years of being a wreck, I managed to regain some semblance of control and get out of my comfort zone. Though I've been driving since 17, I only got my license at 22. I failed the test the first time but I didn't let that discourage me. And even though I have my license, driving still gives me some anxiety! Since getting my license, I'd spent the last 8 months applying to several jobs and only getting one interview during that time. It was discouraging and humiliating. I felt like such a huge failure. But yesterday, that search ended. I went through two interviews with the Best Buy my friend works at. It was their national seasonal hiring event and I was offered a job on the spot as a customer service specialist. The managers who interviewed me were super understanding and very down to Earth about my lack of job experience and I am so happy they gave me a chance! I'm going to do my best to power through the hell that awaits since I'll only have 2.5 weeks of retail experience before Black Friday. I'm anxious and excited to finally be progressing after feeling stuck for so long!! Thanks for reading! <3
Seriously just fuck you. How dare you do this to my mother and to my autistic brother. I mean at least make it worth it for a good looking woman not a fucking horrid boat sized slob. No wonder why you always tried to spend as little as you can even though you love to brag about your $80k salary. Here I am struggling to keep $20 in my bank account and you rather see that than help me out. Oh and you know me going to school? Well i can't continue since you don't even help me out paying for my previous 3 semesters so i'm busting my ass off at a part time job to just finally have a little bit of money and getting myself on track without your ass. Whatever I've lost any and all respect i had for you. I don't want your help. Oh and one more thing... Fuck you. Sincerely your son.
I know lowered expectations aren't a good thing but I am a bit worried. Basically I've been on two dates with this girl and on the second she hugged me after I walked her to her car and I decided to go for a kiss. It ended up being a quick peck because was nervous and I wasn't sure what else to do and then we just said goodbye and left. Before I kissed her she was talking about wanting to go out again this week but now she seems more distant. I'm worried that this kiss was awkward for her or that she wasn't really ready for that yet and just went along with it. My instinct is telling me to apologize for the awkward kiss, but I am not sure that that's the issue and don't want to embarrass myself. Plus constantly apologizing is really unattractive. At the moment I'm just trying to not mention it. This seems like the right course of action but I'm not sure. Did reddit have any advice? --------------- ***TL;DR*** I kissed a girl for the first time ever and was worried it was awkward for her. Should I pre-emptively explain myself even though she hasn't said anything about it yet?
I’ve always felt like everyone was intellectually and socially just ahead of me. I always felt left behind even if people were younger than me. I’m in my second year of community college and my social media friends are all going back to their respective colleges and universities to chase their dreams or at least head in a direction. I say social media friends bc I haven’t really spoken to them since high school graduation. I kinda just like they’re posts. I found out that part of the reason I feel this way is that I may be autistic. Which I’m open to. I’ve always struggled socially growing up and my family just blow it off like I’m a shy introvert and that’s it and eventually I’ll grow out of it. Because of that I’ve never gotten help for it and I probably won’t get any help with it ever or with my autism either if I have it. So being a closet autistic and gay paired up with the fact that I’m directionless just makes living seem pointless. I can’t do a job interview. I can’t drive. I’m too stupid even for community college because I’m on academic probation. I’m just straight up stupid. There is nothing for me in life anymore. I’m gonna take prerequisites at my community college until I have no money and then probably end up homeless and die alone.
i just had a fight with my girlfriend and she brought to my attention that i keep getting angry and that i take it out on her. i realized that i also take it out on my sisters sometimes and even my mom but my girlfriend has been receiving it the most. I love her so much she really means the world to me and it really hurts me to hear that i am hurting her. when i become angry i turn into this very mean person who will do anything to put himself on top. i’m turning into someone i hate, someone that i don’t want around my loved ones. My temper grows shorter and shorter and i can see it myself. i know this post is really lame but i need help. i don’t want to hurt her anymore.
I struggle with, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and chronic migraines. As I realize a lot of the things I struggle with is my fault. But I can’t help it. I have awful panic attacks and every time it’s different feelings, but I always resort to “I’m going to die I’m not ok I need to go to a hospital” I usually get 1-2 panic attacks a day sometimes more sometimes less! I work as a vet tech for a cat only clinic. The coworkers can be annoying about my ADHD and how I forget things sometimes, I often will even get called “retarted” by my own boss... yes it hurts and makes me more paranoid about my issues. But I’m in the midst of trying to find a new job and not because I get paid... the job is WAY too much for how little I’m paid. But finding a new job can be scary esp because I’ve only been here four months. But regardless reddit is making me feel so normal to see all these people struggling with things I struggle with. I love it.
So at a party 1½ months back she told me she used to be a sugarbabe, at first that freaked me out, but I remained silent because she said she stopped after she met me. She doesn't have much money each month, as she lives with high rent and two cats, so it would make sense for her to still be active to get some support to actually live on. She's an artist, though not the greatest but an artist nonetheless, and she has gotten money every month covering it as a commission (oddly enough, its always the same amount of money). I have yet to actually see any digital pictures (or any commission art in general) produced, and when I ask she says she won't show, because its a policy of her's not to show unless the costumer want it public, which I find rather odd as LIT. NO ONE but us would know. I also check on the site she used to use, and she still has an account, even though it's really easy to delete. I don't know what to do, and I really don't want to hurt her, but I can't live like this. --- **tl;dr**: I suspect my girlfriend is a sugarbabe behind my back and has lied to me about it since we met.
For starters I am Bipolar type 1. I live in a room in my parents basement and am a rising sophomore in college. My grades were shit due to my issues last semester and now I am trying to figure out a way to fix that. So my parents have spent the month and a bit I've been home by letting me hang out with friends often and a lot of freedom contradicted with a constant hounding of what 'chores' I hadn't completed. Many of these things are not my parents concern i.e. my laundry or whether my room smells good or bad. They attempted to use that as a reason to move me upstairs so they could keep an eye on me. The pressure inside me reached critical mass and I was done. I told my parents that I hate them and attempted to run away. I yelled "FUCK YOU" to my father while kicking over his recycling bin. I called my parents morally decrepit retards with the value of the shit of our dogs's shit bugs. I specifically elaborated how they meant well but didn't have the mental ability to overcome the retarded information they receive from crazy catholic groups and fox news. I said that their failure to recognize a basic principle to help me get back on my feet negated any positive efforts and their concerns were merely shallow and selfish (this was propagated in the catalyst of the whole argument, when I asked my mother not to inform me of facebook posts I forgot to reply to because it "embarrassed her". I think that this is a gross violation of privacy.) I hate the aftermath of my anger, but feel within its development it isn't unprovoked.
I'm coming up on 22 months since I lost my husband of 18 1/2 years totally unexpectedly. I was firmly in the category of never dating again, no one compares to my husband, until I wasn't. I started seeing a good friend of ours who I always had really good friend chemistry with and could always talk to and laugh with for hours. I realized last night that if my husband were to come back tomorrow, I don't know if I would choose him. The guilt I feel about that realization is incredible. Having moved on and grown enough to realize that my marriage was wonderful but not perfect and that my husband was amazing and I still love him, but I've changed are beyond difficult. This journey is so complicated. For a long time I thought it was just something that I had to get through and that is was a straight line, but it's not. It's hard and painful in ways I never would have expected.
Do any of you have those memories that just... Make you seriously consider murder. I don't mean like, oh yea I wanna kill this guy. I mean really truly considering painfully and slowly ending someones life whenever you think about them or someone brings them up. How do you deal with that? My brothers sperm donor is an absolute jerk, and he refused to let me say goodbye to him after school one day before he took him away for his 2 week vacation. Like him and his wife physically wouldn't let me near my brother and I saw red. It took all my self control not to beat his fat ass into a pulp right there in the parking lot, and now every time I think about that day, it just ruins my mood for hours...i can't physically be in the same room as this man or his wife without having to focus on physically restraining myself from beating him. How do I deal with this?
If you cut your brain wide open would it be full of confetti? Videotape innards? Pennies? Shrapnel? Sequins? Strings? Would all the words you had ever learnt, spring out from your skull, like a jack in the box and land like missiles, jamming themselves in to every surface and exploding with the ferocity of a thousand shooting stars in the depths of the night sky? Would it feel like slimy, sticky, jelly, slipping through your fingers? Dripping, dribbling and draping themselves around the world? And would you coat yourself in its wondrous, lustrous knowledge? Smearing yourself in intellectual nutrients? Laying yourself exposed with all to bare? This is the result of my racing thoughts.
Of the late, I find myself repeatedly circling back to my goals, which are mostly academic, and extremely rigid. I have a national exam in less than two months, and it's an exam that will determine how my life will go down in the next couple years, so the anxiety is real. I have a dream school that I want to enter, but the requirements for entering this school is very strict. So much so, that I have to achieve an A1 for every subject I'm currently taking, one of which is a second language that I'm extremely unconfident in. Which I can't stop thinking about, and it's getting so bad that I find myself unable to focus or start on the rest of my other subjects. How do I stop obsessing over this goal, and repeatedly googling the distinction percentages for this subject (which will later progress to googling the rest of the subjects). It honestly fills me with a lot of dread when I think of not achieving that A1, which I know is foolish, because there's so much more to life than results. But it's hard to stay clear on this when everyone around me (practically the whole country) is so achievement-oriented and place such great emphasis on this particular exam.
I am 14 year old twin boy with crohns disease. I was supposed to start school in a week and my parents just told me that my family and I am going to a new school starting in TWO days. I have two days to get all my NEW school stuff and tel all of my friends. This might sound like a average "oh no I'm moving" complaint but its more. I have crohns which is an annoying painful disease but what makes it worse is the medication. The medication is a SEVERELY painful shot and I get anxiety about this shot. I'm depressed because my life for the past two years has felt like one long ride to a bloodwork appointment. If moving wasnt bad enough the new school I have to go to is a strict private school where instead of art and photo as electives I'm taking religion and computers. Any way please leave comments on how to deal with depression and anger.
As an asian female, I have experienced so much disrespect and discrimination growing up starting from my parents to pretty much the entire society. They have a clear preference for boys over girls and girls always have more rules to follow. This has caused a lot of negative experiences that traumatise me till this day, and any form of disrespect towards me causes me to be reminded of my past traumatic experiences and creates so so much anger that takes me quite a while to get rid of. Today, during a discussion in class about gender inequality, I was sharing my personal experience about how many adult men I know have to be taught household chores, how to take care of children etc. that most of the time the women just choose to do it themselves instead of having to teach and correct their partners all the time. I was clear about how this was my personal experience and by no means a generalisation, but my male classmate decided to take offence at my “tonality”(???), said how worked up I was, how red my face was (I blush easily and have pale skin) and that I needed to chill, instead of focusing on what I was sharing! I was so mad, but just smiled at his response and kept quiet because I knew that was how he expected women to behave and I also didn’t want to cause a scene in class. I find his behaviour so disrespectful and that is a major reason why I choose not to share my thoughts most of the time. It also doesn’t help my anger AT ALL which I am still feeling right now. What are your thoughts? Am I wrong? Is there a better way to handle this kind of attacks?
I feel like there's a lot of stuff about "being ok with being by yourself" and stuff but I dont feel like being by myself right now and I'm reaching out to a bunch of ppl and everyone is busy. I feel like I should just relax at home alone but that's most nights for me bc I live alone. I feel like everyone else is either doing stuff w ppl that arent me or perfectly happy being all alone and I just feel like an idiot. Idk what I want to get out of this post bc what I rly need is physical contact but maybe validation from strangers will help haha
So I mentioned to a couple of my friends that I wanted to start a YouTube channel just for fun. Most of my friends were supportive and thought it could be a fun idea, but one private messaged me and basically told me it was awful. They mostly just said that I’m too late and there’s no point because it’s not like I’m going to get famous or anything. Now I feel stupid and embarrassed for even mentioning it to my other friends. It is probably a dumb idea and I was right to think that people wouldn’t watch my stuff. Are they right? Should I just not even bother? I feel so anxious thinking about it now that I’m just embarrassed to talk to any of my friends in general. I probably look so stupid for even mentioning something like that.
I have no way of letting out my anger so I figured throwing a bunch of glass bottles at something really fast and watching them break would be extremely satisfying. I truly just want to let out my anger on something because it's built up over the years and I know many people on this sub would suggest I try to suppress it but I don't have an anger problem in the sense that I get heated easily. It's just that for nearly a decade I've never had ANYTHING at all to let my anger out on and it's becoming too much. I feel like I'm gonna snap soon.
I will never forget. My husbands mom tells me almost weekly that I need to forget. I don't know if its a language barrier (English is her 2nd language). But when the last person in the world you'd think is telling you to forget about your late husband (her son!), it makes me wonder. What does she mean by forget? She tells me she loves me like I'm her daughter. She said she thinks about me every single day. She tells me no matter what she's loves me until the day she dies 🥺. She cries and says that I'm so young and there's nothing more I can do now and I need to forget. I almost wish I could just forget and actually live. After all, HIS MOM is telling me to. He was her baby, youngest of 5. His death destroyed her. Maybe, she just truly does see me as her daughter and maybe she's saying what she would have to him had he lost me instead. I wish i could forget and that makes me feel guilty. I don't want to erase him. But as time goes on i feel like I'm erasing myself. I'm not living. How long before I reach the point of no return?
I've found this to be the most apparent on &lt;topic&gt; support/help forums. Things like StackOverFlow. If you post a question there would be no doubt some sarcastic asshole that will try as hard as they can to make you feel like shit for the rest of the day. Instead of just you know answering the damn question they'll go over how your proposed soltuion is so **WRONG** and how much of an **IDIOT** you are but they won't say it's wrong or that you're an idiot. They do it subtly. Sentences like "why would the answer be that" or "No....?????" (putting dots and question marks everywhere) posting "lmgtfy" site among tons and tons of other responses that I'm not going to get into. I'm just sick of being ridiculed for no reason. I try to be polite, friendly, non-hostile as I can and still people go out of their way to be an ass to me. I just wish I can ask a question, get it answered with no bitchiness, and go on with my day not thinking of the other person's attitude for the entire day. End rant.
My mom was just denied re-entrance into college for the third time. This means that we won't be receiving any grant money to help support us. Not only this but that also means that we are several thousand dollars in debt. We already live in a cramped low income apartment, and can hardly pay the bills as it is. Because my mom got a job several months ago that the government is just now adressing,'t we went from 500 food stamps to 59. I've applied to everywhere I possibly can but I cant get a job because I'm a highschool student with no work experience. I myself dont need money but it hurts to see my mom this way. And because my dad never actually made her pay child support while he had custody, we can't ask him for any money. He's allowing us to live with her even though he has custody. He kept us away from her through most of our child hood and if he finds out how bad we're doing he'll take us away again. I know that there are people worse off than me but its kind of down putting when shopping at goodwill on clearance days still isnt in our budget. =/
So lately I've been sending out emails to offer my freelance services and get my business off the ground. I feel bad for pestering people but the responses I've had have generally been positive. Anyway, a business contact suggested I email other people from his company. I wondered if I should ask him if I could mention his name in the emails (e.g. "Hi, ... said I should contact you") but my friends said it should be fine if I just went ahead and did it, so like an idiot I did. For some reason I thought I'd be annoying bothering him to ask when everyone was saying it'd obviously be fine. I definitely should have checked with him. I just got an email asking me to stop using his name when I contact people from his company. I don't know what repercussions me mentioning him as a connection has had for him, because the email he sent me was very short and abrupt. I've apologised but I just feel like an absolutely horrible person and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how much damage I've done and I wish that I had just checked in the first place. Do you have any advice for moving on from this? I really can't get it out of my head, because I know it's my fault. But I feel like some people would move on from this within a few minutes whereas I will feel terrible for days.
My girlfriend and I broke up about a month ago. It was pretty mutual -- largely regarding distance. She texted me today that she was in the city i live near (I'm in the suburbs) and said that I owe it to her and to our relationship that we meet and "close" in person. Besides the fact that I cannot get there (I have 2 major appointments I cannot miss and am reliant on my parents driving me) am I wrong in thinking that I don't owe her or us anything like this? I feel very uncomfortable seeing her as we've been no contact and I'm still not ready to jump into something like this, especially this far after we've broken up. --- **tl;dr**: ex-girlfriend saying I owe her closure in person. Besides the fact it is logistically very difficult, I still don't feel comfortable meeting her to do this. What do I do? Do I really owe her this?
So I recently applied and interviewed for a lead position at my job. I felt pretty confident in my ability to get the promotion and felt I interviewed well. I really feel like I’ve learned a lot in the two years that I’d been there. Especially since I was working in a completely new field. I even made an effort to learn to do things other people hated doing or didn’t want to bother to learn. So, silly me thought,”I totally got this!” Jokes on me though. The choices were between me and two of my other coworkers. I’m 34 the other two are both 24. It stings so much worse knowing as a 34 year old I can’t even get a lead position. I just feel stuck. My manager brought me into his office today to tell me I didn’t get the job and why. Then started bullshitting me on how I was such a good candidate. I just couldn’t hear it. My mind just shut down. I was stunned. I told myself before the interview that I wouldn’t give a shit at all if I didn’t get it. It’s whatever. But now I’m just so crushed. I had to leave work early. And I’ve been weeping all day. I feel so embarrassed with myself. I feel stupid. I feel betrayed. I feel like a loser. I feel old. I feel like what’s the point. Just needed to get that off my chest. It won’t help but I needed to say it.
I stood up for myself! Something I haven’t been able to do for a while, but I did it. And it felt sooooo good. I’ve been going through some rough things lately and someone tried to tell me how to be, and what I should do, and tried to push me into doing things I wasn’t ready for. I didn’t take the blame for what he did, or how he felt (that’s what normally happens), and when he tried to blame me in a way, I put him in his place! So proud of myself right now, and I just wanted to share my achievement. It’s a huge one for me!
Hey so my girlfriend of 7 months doesn’t trust me whenever we aren’t in the same place. When she and I are at different locations, she would constantly call over and over again until I pick up. Though I try to pick up as soon as possible, I’m just not one of those people who keeps their phone in their pocket at all times. For example she’s on a trip right now and we’ve been video calling 2 times a day everyday, and yet when I’m doing school work or hanging out with my friends she’ll call/text me because she doubts I’m saying the truth. I feel like no matter how I say the truth, she always shows some hesitance. On another note, when we aren’t together, and I leave my house to the convenience or a friends house, my girlfriend somehow knows. Then I get spammed with texts and calls wondering where I’m at. I’m not sure if she’s got a tracking app to my phone or if she knows if my phones moving? I have no idea how she’s able to know when I’m out of the house. I know it may sound suspicious, but I can’t always be having multiple calls to my phone all the time. Does anyone know how my gf is able to know where I am? And does it have to do with my phone (iPhone 8) or apps? TLDR: my girlfriend doesn’t trust me when we aren’t together; every time I leave the house, she knows and calls me repeatedly about my *intentions*
Over the last few years I've gotten real well at keeping my anger at bay. So much so that I done explode anymore, if not ever. However, my problem now is lashing out / snapping at people who speak to me with specific tones. For example I coach high school sports. Most of my anger is released through the exercise part of it, but when it comes to other coaches telling me how to do my job (or not telling me how to and then getting mad at me when I don't know what they want) I find myself biting my tongue and putting my angry feelings on my players. Not abusing them just being short with them when theyve done nothing wrong. I almost called another coach a cunt out of anger because she used a bitchy tone when telling me she hates the music I play when my players practice in the gym. Another time a different coach screamed at me in front of my players when I didn't run a drill right and I almost screamed at her to go fuck herself. I've worked hard to get to the point where I don't say anything out loud, but I want to get to the point where I don't get angry if at all. If not for me at least for my players who need a level headed coach. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, my point is how do I train myself to not get so enraged when people use a tone that instantly makes my blood boil? Thank you in advance!
When I first joined this school people thought I was cool so I had a lot of friends and was approached by many girls. Now people don’t even notice me I’m just a ghost walking down the hallways, now today one of my classmates tried to fight me because he was annoyed of me because I never speak and think I’m a smart ass. I didn’t want any of it but he wanted to fight. My only “friend” I had didn’t even take my side. So now I’m just isolated and Alone with no one to turn to I feel like my life is full of holes and is now pointless. What should I do?
Oh boi, first things first, I think this is an accurate subreddit, but I'm not sure, don't beat me too hard please. I did get a suggestion from a doctor that it's possible might be social anxiety. For the past 6-7 months I've been in a LDR with a really fantastic guy. We see each other from time to time and we both love each other as hell. He helped me get over many of my anxiety related issues. But there are some things that even the best partner can't help with. I don't have anyone that I could call a friend. Absolutely no-one. I'm over all terrified by some social situations. I can't talk with people. Meeting the necessary amount of people a week makes me have enough social activities for a month. At the same time I hate being social, I want to be alone. On the other hand sometimes I crave friends. He goes out with them, for pubs, drinks, parties, has fun. As much as I usually can't stand socializing, this makes me jealous. In those moments I want friends. I want company. I want to socialize. But I can't find them, can't attract them, I can't keep friendships neither talk with people. I'm jealous, sad, confused. I honestly don't know what to do. Maybe I'm exaggerating, and if so, I'm sorry. I just really don't know anymore.
I'm a guy who is in a relationship with a guy (we are both around 20) and we are going to a gay club with a big group of friends. He's been to the club alone and we've gone together once before, but everytime I get really anxious about going because I imagine some really hot guy is going to hit on my boyfriend, and something will happen. He's never cheated on me and he tells me I'm out of his league sometimes, and I really don't think he's that type of person. But when we're in the club, I always think some guy is going to try and hit on him and take him away from me. There have been a couple instances where (admittedly gross looking) guys have tried to hit on him and my BF was visibly uncomfortable, but then when I walked up they saw we were together and then left him alone. Anyways, looking for some tips on not to be so nervous. We've been together for over a year.
in my case , i really anger without a reason , i really cant play games , or talk about some countries or people , because i just start being extremly... how to call it? angry and dangerous , its not the first time i just hit myself or bute myself or hit the keyboard for the most little things , and slowy is getting worse and worse , i get even triggered when people start talking about protogens (ya know , furry robots) that rage goes even to people in real life , i remember calling my motger a whor- "woman with not acceptable clothes" and throwing things at her , and no , in my case its not because "too much videogames or internet" knowing that i dont even play games anymore just for the fear of harming myself or anyone , does someone have... idk , somethin to help me? (sorry if i did any grammar/spelling error)
We broke up earlier this month, two days ago would have been our one year anniversary. The vinyl was supposed to ship this month, however I do not know the status of the order because the order updates are getting sent to her email, but I paid for it entirely on my card and I have the records to prove it in my bank account. Is it wrong for me to keep the vinyl from her? Am I legally entitled to it as my property? **tl;dr Preordered my ex a limited edition vinyl from a band we both enjoy, and now we're broken up and I want to keep it since I paid for it.**
I kind of lost track of him. He was a very secretive and low key person. So he didn't really do Facebook or social media. Always used super fake names, no face pictures. That sort of thing. We were friends for years. I just want to apologize for something I said. He lives like, 5 minutes from my house. I could easily walk straight to his house. Would it be okay to pop over a visit? I have no numbers or anyway to reach him. The only other way would be through his brother in law who I am sort of friends with. He is friends with me on Facebook. If I sent a message asking about my friend, would that be creepy or weird? Would it be wrong to pay him a visit out of the blue? He never called me names or was mad at me, he never told me to get lost. He just lives with his family. I know him pretty well I think. tldr no way to contact my old friend except his brother in law on facebook, he only lives 5 minutes from my house, would it be inappropriate to pay him a visit?
This has started happening as I've gotten older. I'm currently only 25 When I get into an argument/disagreement with a potential partner, or friend (mainly friend in my situations) I seem to not really care of working things out after the first disagreement and I just stop talking to them. I don't ignore them or be rude, I just stop thinking about them and I stop going out of my way to talk things out. &nbsp; I use to always try and cling to certain friends in my life, even fighting for months to have them as a friend. Now I just stop really caring and trying. Sometimes I worry that maybe I'm being overly emotional because obviously not every friendship will be perfect 100% of the time &nbsp; Thoughts? **TL;DR;** : Used to care for talking things out with friends, now no longer feel need and feel like it may be hurting me socially. Wut do?
First, I want to say that this did not make sense to me. How can we live everyday like the last. It was in fact not the last day. Everyone who don't want to die need to anticipate, plan and build the life forward. But today, this idea flashed back to my mind and I found it incredibly liberating. I recently experience another wave of depression and a lot of things are taking me down. I don't like the work I am doing. I worry about money. I worry about our parents. and most of all, I feel very sad about not having her with me and worry about how I could make it right going forward. Then I somehow remember her life and our life before. She indeed was living her life like her last day. I guess we both were. We never played safe. We didn't want to have regular life staying at home or have a regular job. we went abroad for study. We traveled the world and worked at different counties. She alway wanted to experience the maximum. I lost this when I lost her. But what have I got to lose now? Do I really care if I die tomorrow? It is actually a relief if I did. I have been focusing on keeping myself alive after I lost her. But being just alive is not what I want. that is why I am depress. For the rest of my days, isn't it beautiful if I can truly live without worries and go on with the live she was living even without her. I hope that will be a short and beautiful moment just like the memories with her in my mind.
By way of context: I was diagnosed with GAD in February and my psychiatrist put me on Lexapro. I was on 5mg for 3 weeks, 10mg for two, and 7.5mg for one. I couldn’t hang with the constant dizziness I had at 10mg and 7.5mg, so we made the decision at the beginning of this week to taper off and work on finding a new medication. However, as soon as I went down to 5mg, I started to feel much better both side effect wise and with the cessation of my physical anxiety symptoms (primarily constant tension headaches). So I suppose my question is this: has anyone else had success at a super low dose of an SSRI? I know my doctor is going to tell me this is below the therapeutic level of the drug so I’m just curious about others experiences. Thanks!
I'm a M26 and since I was 12 years old I have had issues with anxiety and depression. I started therapy four months ago and been on medication that works quite well for the past three weeks now. A week ago I wasn't having any issues with anxiety and depression at all but all of a sudden, today, I started to have major issues with my anxiety. I don't know why or how. I thought I was finally cure from it but I guess not. I stopped smoking weed, drinking alcohol, only drinking a glass of homemade ice coffee in the morning, I switched to a vegetarian diet and been using kettle bells to work out. I want to start doing meditation too but haven't dive in yet. Basically my question is will I ever feel normal? Well I be cured of anxiety and depression ever? What even is normal? I'll take any advice that will help with my anxiety as well. I believe my anxiety is due to anger??? Meaning, I don't deal with stress well and I replay things in my mind over and over again until I get angry. Is that causing my anxiety to get worse and if so, what do I do to stop it?
[CW: Suicidal ideation] And I'm tired of not being able to tell people that I desperately don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. I got a new job. I moved across the country. All of that kept me kind of distracted for, like, a month. Now I sit alone in this house and just. Just exist? But only just? Everything from this point on is a distraction. Anything good that happens feels like a consolation prize. I feel like I'm acting like a spoiled fucking child that didn't get their way. And I just don't want to do *this* anymore. I am not suicidal, but when you are, nobody wants to know you are. They'll have you put away somewhere until you can tell them that you don't want that anymore. I can't tell anyone that I don't want to *be* anymore without them getting that look that they think I'm about to do something stupid. I'm too much of a coward for that. I just. I just don't want to fucking do this anymore. I'm tired, I *hurt*, and every day is the same fucking thing. And then I work myself up to the point of exhaustion and tell myself that it'll be better tomorrow. And sometimes it is, but that only lasts a moment in the grand scheme of things. I just want to go home...
right, so here's the thing. i feel fat. i know that i'm fat. i don't look fat, but my stomach bulges out and whenever i squeeze my gut i can feel all the visceral fat there. the bottom half of my uniform is tight because of my gut. i get that. i've been trying to eat less and work out (limiting to ~1200 kcal) but nothing is working out. i don't have anyone to talk to about this feeling fat and feeling sad all the time. i take refuge in my weight and weight loss so much that i've begun isolating myself because while i ask everyone how they've been doing, they don't seem to ask back, so i don't tell them anything. they think i'm fine, i look like i'm fine, but i'm dying inside from the stress of my weight, my relationships with other people and my grades, whether i'll be good enough, etc. i'm so tired of this - to the point that i don't want to see anyone anymore.
We found out I was pregnant again, last week. I had a miscarriage last month and decided to go on the depo shot. We waited loner than what they recommended to start having sex again, surprise, I got pregnant again. Right off the bat, my numbers were low (172), which wasn't alarming until they came back at 203 - 48 hours later. I went to the ER for cramping another 48 hours later and it went up to 213. We did a blood draw yesterday (another 48 hours) and got the results back that it's at 226. After thinking on it, I can't risk an ectopic and one of my tubes bursting or deal with my body taking weeks to miscarry. I can't deal with that. I haven't even healed from my first miscarriage. So I opted to get the methotrexate shot tomorrow. My mom is furious that I'm doing it "artificially". I don't want anyone judging me or telling me that I need to wait. I've been told several times that it isn't viable. I just need someone to talk to.
What do I do now? I'm thinking about punching everyone. I'm to afraid to open my fucking mouth so that I don't say something that I'll regret. Everyone here are hypocrites with their double standards. Their faces burn scars into my memory. I never want to see them again. I wish that they will drop dead. They show me no respect and they treat me like I'm a piece of shit. They have given me pain from all the fucking stress. I try to meditate to calm down, but when ever I do they never shut up. They make fun of me about everything from my dates to how I look. They have destroyed my self confidence and my self respect. I'm sick of them watching me for a new joke so I suppress my emotions hoping that they will get bored, but they found out. Now they keep waiting. They do what ever they can to push me over the top. They laugh when I turn into nothing but tears and rage. I'm constantly tired. I'm losing my energy faster than it can be regained. They never let me have a minuet to my self even now they are sitting across from me waiting for a sign that I'm about to break, and if they keep acting like this they will see it.
I have been getting therapy for my anxiety for a couple of years or so, and my therapist is a wonderful person. Over those years, she had always put up with me when I poured my hearts out. I mean, I do know for a fact that it's basically her job to do so, *being a therapist and all.* But from a human standpoint (well, my standpoint anyway), it's difficult to not get attached to someone who has always been there to help you when you need it. Over the course of the period of my therapy, I start to see her as a parent figure. Whenever she told me that she's proud of me when I make progress, I just want to give her a big hug. And ever since I start studying overseas, it's been a good while since I last met her, and I actually really miss her. I know I have to keep our relationship strictly professional. And honestly, I'm embarrassed at myself for being so childish and feeling this way. But I can't help it, y'know? Has anyone here ever had a similar experience?
Tomorrow will be six months without him and I can’t stop crying. This feels like the hardest milestone yet because I remember days after he died and I was having a panic attack... I remember saying I don’t want it to be the day that I have to say he died six months ago. And tomorrow is that day. I don’t want it to be the day that I say it happened a year ago. Five years ago. Ten years ago. We’re getting so far away from when he was alive and it hurts so much. I don’t want the days to keep coming, I don’t want to keep living through everyday without him. Why is this shit so hard. I miss him so much. This month we should be celebrating one year of marriage and nine years as a couple. Instead I’ve now been a widow longer than I was a wife. Instead, I weep alone because he is dead. There is nothing to celebrate.
Today it was a great day ! In France we have an exam which is called « baccalauréat » and i pass it with sucess ! So my friends and i were very proud and i proposed to make a party in a pub tonight but i forget: they all have a family, ans they all gonna make a party with their own family. Hard. My mother isn’t home and their os only with violent step father at home. My boyfriend invited me to a party with his family. It’s nice but it’s hard to understand that you have to give your pussy if you want a little bit of an impression of someon’s caring about you. Im writting this in the train and im crying.
I (23F) unfortunately had a miscarriage back in May this year. It was really early on, and I think it was due to the stress (I was petrified) and shock of it all as it happened about a week after I found out. It was so early on that I never got so far as getting a scan (all my discussions were with medical professionals via telephone because of COVID) so sometimes I feel like I don’t have a right to feel upset. Is that normal? Do I have the right? It’s such a confusing thing to go through. At the time, the thought of being a parent absolutely terrified me because there are so many things I want to put in place first, but ever since it’s happened, I can’t stop thinking about it, and the desire to start a family burns deeper every day. Honestly, I think I’m still just working through the trauma of it all as there’s many things in my life I’d have to change before making a commitment as big as having a child. I feel really ashamed that this happened because I was careless with birth control (which has changed now) and although my family would be supportive with giving me advice I just feel like I’d be burdening them, which is why I’m posting here, if that makes sense? Has/does anyone feel/felt like this? What do you do to cope? Does it ever really get any easier? Thanks for reading!
I (25F) was in a abusive relationship from age 16-20 and I've finally acknowledged that it will never leave me, but I want to find more ways to cope. Advice? During the relationship I lost myself. I became easily controlled, distant, judgmental towards others... Wondered how I "got here," hated myself for letting stuff happen- that I "needed" him... Everything in my life at that point was out of character, but there I was. I wondered how I would ever tell anyone without them looking at me differently. I already pushed everyone away so much and the thought of them telling other people horrified me. It took me over three years to tell my current boyfriend and some family. When I finally opened up to them it helped, but even with that (and time) I still get day dreams about instances, nightmares that incorporate my past into my current life, never ending anxiety over people's intentions, and doubting my judgement. I still feel spite towards my ex for everything he did and I just wish I could resolve it. Karma doesn't exist, I realized that too. TLDR: Ex boyfriend was abusive and I have long term issues that I wish I could move beyond, but I don't know how.
I ended our slightly over a year long relationship 3 and a half years ago. He has contacted me via text, email, he's looked at my LinkedIn a few times until I blocked him (he's already blocked on Facebook), he sent me a request on YouTube red (who does that???) and at that point I blocked him on Twitter and Instagram even though he hadn't used those yet. He's blocked on league of legends I'm pretty sure, or at least removed from my friends list. He sent me a text on Jan 7: "Hey MsDemacia, totally respect your answer if you say no, though it's been awhile and I miss having you around as a friend. Would you maybe want to play League with me and catch up some time? *ex name*" I really don't want to be friends with him because I don't want him in my life at all. He weirds me out. I want him to stop trying to contact me. He really needs to move on. It's been 3 and a half years and I've had a boyfriend for the past 3 years that I'm beyond happy with. Everyone says to keep ignoring him. I just want him to move on with his life and forget about me so he can leave me alone. If I block his number (idk how lol) he'll still try to find me some other way. So I just want him to stop. TL;DR: Ex keeps contacting me in different ways and I want him to stop.
I’ve just lost confidence in so many aspects of my life. I am starting to completely lose motivation 😞 There’s a competition i’m entering in for my university and I completely doubt myself because of past experiences. :( i get so sad because I always say horrible words to myself like I hate myself, I wish I could die, i’m so unlikeable, i’m so dumb. It’s really painful, especially when the most embarrassing events happened to me in public. I think I have some form of toxic shame. I just feel like my mental health is worsening, it’s just getting worse and worse and it’s destroying my self esteem on a daily basis :( I think it’s because of all the constant traumatic experiences i’ve had that makes me feel a horrible way about myself. I am just super sad at this point, if anyone understands feel free to message me I don’t really have close friends to talk too as well. I am crippling inside, it’s a horrible place to be
I lost my father when I was fourteen in 2007. And around that time I read a book that truly helped me comfort wise, called For One More Day by Mitch Albom. He’s also well known as the author of Tuesday’s with Morrie, another book that helped tremendously. Losing my dad so young I never got the chance for our relationship to change from knowing each other as child and adult to two fellow adults. I’ve always had so many questions for him. Some of them deep, and some just random and silly. Time sometimes ensures you never know your parents. I had the idea recently to make a, For One More Day list, where I would write out all the questions I’ve always wanted to ask if I did have one more day with him. I really do feel it’s been helping me, even if I may not know the answers, the questions I’m asking I know he would have some opinion or answer to them all. I just wanted to share in case others may want to try and see if it helps them in any way with their pain and healing. I used to think that grief was supposed to end at some point, that maybe one day it would have gone through “all seven stages”, but grief is never ending. Don’t get me wrong, the days become easier and it gets easier to hide the pain, you are able to look back at those memories and love and not break down. And there will be times that you do and that is one million percent okay. Some days will hit harder, but try to remember all that love. I’m here for you all through whatever you are going through.
For the past year, my anxiety has actually been manageable and I've been able to handle it pretty well. This past week has been awful tho. On Monday I started getting an upset stomach and on Tuesday I was throwing up and using the bathroom nonstop. At first, I was like this okay I'm only nervous because I have an interview. Then on Thursday I threw up again and could not stop going to the bathroom. At around 3 am I had a panic attack while I was home alone. I've just been having panic attacks and feeling super anxious since. I actually had an okay day yesterday and didn't break down. But today I broke down immediately after waking up. I just feel so scared. Like I'm never going to get better. Anyone else feel the same at times?
Ok so i feel like im alone with this. My Anxiety is so bad when it comes to going over my fiancée house(he lives with his parent's right now) becauae i know I'll have to interact with his mom & dad. The problem is i get so scared and anxious i freeze up and the sad part is i have know them all way before my fiance and i started dating I'd say for a good 8 years from going to the same church and it was easier back then to talk to them but now that im with their son its very hard for me to hold a convo with them. They tell my fiancée they want me around way more but i feel its physically impossible. Be4 going inside the house my heart beats so fast, i sweat almost cry and start shaking... i just want to be able to speak and be normal with my future in laws & it sucks because they now feel im not even trying 😔 i don't know what to do....
I just needed somewhere to write this all down. 2011 was supposed to be my year, but so far it has been nothing but trouble. Despite being in my dream school and studying the major I was "destined" to study, I've failed miserably. Beyond that, I recently found out my parents are getting divorced. I came home from college to pick up the pieces and help out my younger sister, only to find that all the friends I left behind have been destroyed by drugs, and then one of them died last week. I was keeping strong and holding it all together until I got sick. Like, really sick. Kidney failure and what looks like lupus. I wasn't even sad about it, I just felt kind of lost. Having an expiration date stamped to your forehead wasn't as frightening of an experience as I thought it would be. But last night I was dumped by someone who swore they would never drop me. I lost my best friend and my support system. I'm at the end of my rope. I've been mumbling "I just want to go home" under my breath for months now, but I don't know where that is. And I know there's worse out there and that I shouldn't complain, and trust me, I've been so strong you guys. I haven't cried about it once. I keep telling everyone that everything will be okay. I know I really shouldn't complain, but spare the hating and just let me vent. tl;dr I'm venting.
Sorry for the confusing title... I wanted to take my husband to the escape room (a place where you try to escape a room using wit or whatever) and have all his friends go with too. After I brought up the idea to them and they all said yes, I decided to reserve a room, but the place made me prepay for tickets. So I did, but it was over $300 for everyone!! I'm a poor colleg e student, and I was really hoping to only have to pay for my husband and I. I texted them and asked them to bring $28 per person and now I'm a little nervous about it...Was that cheap of me to do? I even encouraged them to bring their wives so I wouldn't be the only girl there! And I especially feel bad that they all agreed before I made it clear how much it was going to be, or even that they would have to pay at all. Tl;dr: Was it poor etiquette to ask my husbands friends to pay me back for tickets to an event for his birthday that I invited them to? What would you think if you were in my husbands friends shoes?
Hi everyone. I recently adopted a cat, Snowball, literally a week ago. She was a white, 16lb girl from a local rescue of mine. She was acclimating well to my apartment and I was so in love with her personality. She wasn’t eating too much, which according to the rescue is normal for stressed out animals due to a change in living situations. Well, turns out, she was actually extremely ill. She was vomiting yesterday afternoon, was very lethargic, so I brought her to the vet. They then recommended her to the emergency vet. She passed about hours later. I’m absolutely devastated.. and they are saying that it looks like it was fatty liver disease due to her jaundice and ultrasound. I wish her old owners would have not made her so overweight, this may have not happened. Poor baby was sooo young, only 4. I’m So heartbroken. Kind words would be wonderful. How do I cope? Thanks
Anyone have this issue? Despite needing a hobby or something to help you relax that DOESN'T stress me out, I still try to avoid stuff that won't pertain to my future. I'm in the media/creative industry so I need to constantly develop my skills to remain relevant and employable (despite me not even being done post secondary). It's hard to make time for myself to just ENJOY something for ME. Even though my therapist said I need that. My worth doesn't revolve around a potential future career and I know when I think like this, I get too anxious to do anything at all and I just sit around all day on my "free time" doing absolutely nothing because if it. I literally resort to taking my anxiety meds at times just to do something I'd enjoy... Does anyone have an issue like this? Where you avoid enjoyable hobbies that you want to pursue because you feel they won't benefit you in a professional future?
Don't even know if this is the place to put this but yeah, I'm sad. No real friends. Only real friend had a baby 3 months ago and it's not his fault but he's practically gone now. My ex left me because she said she didn't want a relationship. Wasn't my fault, just needed space, all that crap. With a new guy 28 days later. Has become the popular stereotype now. More makeup, shorter clothes, going out all the time. Now I know I was the loser holding her back. Seems like everyone's life gets better when they get rid of me. Now I was alone at Christmas hugging an old teddy bear crying myself to sleep. Yippee. I really dunno what else to do.
It's the closest I've ever come to a real accident. He merges right into me on the fucking interstate, I lay on my horn. He doesn't attempt to stop merging, just smirks at me in his side mirror. My car ends up inches behind his bumper and I'm struggling to slow down. Then THEN the motherfucker BRAKE CHECKS ME smiles, and actually slams on his brakes I throw my hands up in the universal WTF stance, give him the finger, and HE GIVES ME THE FINGER BACK Fucker, no you didn't You just ran me into the bumpers on the road, inches from the guardrail, inches from your piece of shit car, and YOU have the audacity to flick ME off? I sped up next to him and screamed "***what the fuck is your problem***" out my window. He just glared at me and honked for no reason as I passed. If I had hit him, and I *almost* did, I bet it would have been considered my fault. Fucking christ what is wrong with this world
My bf told me he's going out for a walk with his best friend, male. I asked if I can join, he said yes. Then he texted his friend - the friend said he doesn't want me to come (my bf claims the friend wants to hang out alone, just the two of them). I got mad because I thought he should stand up for me and tell his friend something (this is not even the first time his friend did this). Ofc, I don't think my bf should spend all his time with me and have no friends, but it bothers me that he doesn't want to tell a word to his friend who I think is being an ass. He thought his friend wasn't rude, but simply wants to hang out alone. If any of my friends said I couldn't bring my bf, I'd tell them to fuck off. I feel pathetic that his friend behaves that way, completely uncalled for, and my bf gets mad at me instead of him. Thanks! **Tl;dr I got into a fight with my bf when he didn’t stand up for me after his friend said he didn’t want me to come with them for a walk.**
My girlfriend Geo is Korean American, we're both juniors and her brother is a freshmen. Geo is gorgeous and I really like her a lot. She has a brother Max who's a freshmen. Max came up to her at school and asked if he could have $5 for a coffee because he was cold. She gave him the money and told him they'll talk later at home. She asked what time he would be home and they went there separate ways. I asked my girlfriend how did your mother have a white baby if she's Korean? as a joke. She looked at me, rolled her eyes and walked away. I tried to talk to her in Chemistry but she completely ignored me. I spoke to my friends and they think he's adopted into her family. She calls him her little/baby brother all the time. He has the family name. They live in the same house. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **TL;DR:** I Think I offended my girlfriend by asking how she could have a white little/baby brother.**
My house is what my mom likes to call off the beaten path. I live in a small town that is literally surrounded by trees. My town is not that big. We have one high school and everyone goes there. Last night It was 8 pm and I was walking home from my friend Ashley's house. Ashley called me to tell me I forgot my textbook for math, and that she'd give it to me tomorrow. Wendy and Ashley had the idea for me to cut through the woods to get closer to my house to save 15 minutes. I thought it was a good idea because I've done it before only during the day. I walked though the woods at night and I made it out in 10 minutes. I accidentally let her now what I did, and she's all pissed off at me for walking through the woods. She said I don't know how stupid it is to walk into the woods in the dark. I said I'd done it before and she's taken away my PS4. I pre ordered my WWE game on there and now I can't get it. She thinks it's because I love scary movies and just scary stories that I don't think of the worse. --- **tl;dr**: How do I get her to calm down?
I dont know if i have anger as a condition, but I have ptsd. Im a very angery person. I hate everyone. I genuinely feel as if im the only person i know with half a brain and i have constant violent images in my brain about every single person i know including my partner. I think i have a very high iq and i have a hard time when people dont understand things immediately the way i feel like i do. Every little thing puts me one inch closer to my breaking point and I'm worried I'll hurt someone else if i don't kill myself first. I know reddit isn't a therapy tool, but can anyone point me towards some useful info online that can help me to stop feeling this way. I dont want to hurt anyone and saying mean things is too easy and it doesn't make any progress.
It’s been 2.5 months since Mom left us, 4.5 since I saw her (while she was still healthy) because she fought hard in the hospital. I’d been doing better but everything reminds me of her lately. Mostly good, but even those little “bad” things you hold onto. And all of it makes me want to cry. I’m just rambling I guess, but so want a hug from her. Trying to find comfort in being there for Dad. Saw his car near my work today, and left him a sweet note on his window (didn’t want to bother him while visiting his friends). It’s just tough lately.
I suffered a long time from depression and was doing good, but then I went and feel for a girl in highschool and missed my chance, I thought now things would be different but I just fucked it up again, how doesn't love make you feel like shit, this shouldn't affect me like this, but it does, why can't I just forget the emotions and be friends, y can't I stop thinking about her, I had to delete her number to control myself from textn her and now I feel sadder from cutting her out of my life. I've only had one gf and I'm 22 I guess u could call me a loser idc I just wish I had someone that wanted to hug and kiss me as much as I want to with them, I have so much time ahead of me to find that so why can't I stop from crying or stop these chest pains and frogs in my throat Idk what to do, I've cut her off communications from her with me so maybe some day we can be friends, but deep down I feel this is the end of me and her, and I'll never c her again except maybe by accident and then I'll just as bad as I do now, and shell still just b a friend, saying this kind of made me feel better, just wish I could find some one who thinks I'm worth it
I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember. Pretty severe anxiety, at that. (At one point, it flowered into full-on Panic Disorder.) While I'm mostly functional now, my GAD has still severely impaired my quality of life. My existence is shrouded by a fog of anticipatory anxiety. What's more, my experience of the illness has been largely resistant to medication and therapy. A few months back, I decided to bite the bullet and see if supplements helped me at all. After some research, I went out and got a bottle of L-theanine capsules. I didn't expect much, but figured I didn't have much to lose, either. WOW, y'all. This is only my personal experience, but the difference has been night and day. Just 300 mg daily has wildly improved not only my subjective experience, but also my tangible ability to function like an actual human being. Some disclaimers: * Again, this is only my personal experience. Medications can have drastically different effects from person to person. * While I feel profoundly different on the day-to-day, I still very much have GAD. L-theanine has just improved my default mood and ability to cope with stress. * While L-theanine has been a total game changer for me, I can't go so far as to recommend it. My main reasons are that 1) there's little research on its long-term use, and 2) supplements are often poorly regulated. * It seems like most people who regularly use L-theanine only experience subtle effects. No idea why it seems to help me so dramatically. * Assuming L-theanine \*does\* work this well for you, it's still no replacement for actual treatment. If you haven't already, please look into getting professional help.
It’s been two years since I felt this anxious. When I got better after therapy, I thought I was strong enough to deal with anything that comes my way. But today, after a massive fight with my flat mate, it felt as if problems are never ending. I felt as if I’m drowning again. It’s been four hours since I’ve been trying to sleep, and at this point I know I will not be able to. Partly because I know I’ll wake up to the same stress. I wish life were easier, surviving with people was easier. I started shaking when we fought, and I have not been able to stop my body from shivering ever since then. I’ve been trying to hold myself because my sister is stressed too and I want her to feel that we can deal with this new problem. But it’s too much. I want to sleep for as long as it takes for the problems to solve themselves.
I let his dumbass behavior get to me today. I can't believe I let that fucker get me angry like that once more. He doesn't fucking work, HE HASN'T EVEN LOOKED AT A JOB IN MONTHS. "Oh he's working on it, he's gonna change soon" is the LIE I've been told for TWO GODDAMN YEARS. Yet his STOLEN MONEY is so plentiful that he goes to New York for four days! Then, the black guy that he CURSED OUT FOR NO REASON and called racial slurs sends him a text, telling him he knows he's out of town, and that he'll watch that ASSHOLE'S place while he's gone. Then I get to drive to his garbage filled apartment to see everything is fine, his $500 laptop, and $400 PS4 ARE FUCKING PERFECT. Yet he hasn't taken me to the doctor in fucking years, even with my worsening heart problem. I let the thought, that he could've put me in danger, and my belongings in danger, get me more mad than I've been in I don't know how long. I could feel it I was so mad. My heart was beating so hard and fast I could feel it. All from the idea that THAT STUPID, LAZY JACKASS WASTED EVEN A SINGLE PENNY BECAUSE OF HIS STUPIDITY AND RACISM. Sorry for the rant, just need to vent a bit...
when im around others i feel like its a lot harder to get ticked off rather than when im alone. I just got done playing a game in which i lost in embarrassing fashion and I couldnt stop getting angry at my self to the point where my actions handling the loss were also embarrassing. This type of contrast between me socializing in groups and me handling myself in isolation has been going on since I hit adolescence i guess and I just wanna find that balance again. Everytime I say im not going to behave that way again, I get caught up in the moment or emotionally invested in a game and there i go raging again. Its hard man
I've noticed that over the past four months or so I have been getting more agitated with people in general, including my friends. It's getting to the point that I'm nitpicking certain aspects of their personalities and getting really annoyed with them. I don't express my annoyance with them in person but keep it to myself. Afterwards I don't feel like hanging out with them as often. It's a really bizarre feeling that I have never experienced before. I'm just wondering if someone has gone through this or if this comes with age. **tl;dr** starting to become more and more irritated with people and friends as I'm getting older. I start to pick at certain aspects of their personality that I don't like.
I know the first step to solving any issue is to admit that you have a problem. I was hanging out with a friend and I was typing something down and he just kept staring at me. I kept telling him to stop and that it was bothering me. Next thing I know I have snapped and I am threatening to attack him with an upright vacuum cleaner. We made up, but this is serious. I need to get my anger under control before I hurt someone or something. What can you suggest that would help get this under control before it gets too bad?
What things do you do to deal with feelings of being overwhelmed? I'm not sure if any of you feel that way, but I feel it strongly when my anxiety acts up. I'm hoping someone else feels that way? It's weird. I could get a ton of things done one day, then the next day, the smallest task or upcoming event, suddenly feels overwhelming. Then once it's passed, I realized I sweated over nothing. I wish I could tell my brain ahead of time that it'll be okay. I'm not a procrastinator. I'm usually the person who likes to take care of things as they come, right away. I'm just always in my head wondering what kind of ball might drop. It comes from fear, and it's really annoying. I wish I could just roll with things and not get so worked up.
I found out at 10+5 that our second baby no longer had a heartbeat. I am pretty crushed but dealing with it pretty well, overall. I am so grateful for the son that I have and I plan to honor the baby I lost by making some legitimate life changes. I am super heartbroken about it but the kicker right now is that my best friend (who lives in another state but with whom I am deeply close and in regular contact) got pregnant 6 or so weeks before me (after some struggle to conceive). As a mom and a best friend I really want to want to be there for her. I genuinely want her to have a healthy baby/pregnancy but I’m having trouble squaring that with the feeling of blanket resentment that I feel toward currently pregnant women. I mean, I think my plan is to take more time. It has only been a week since I started bleeding (I took misoprostol Tuesday and my bleeding has slowed down a fair amount as of recently). This whole experience really feels like a cruel joke and then with the added dimension of my desire to abandon my best friend because of my grief just adds more grief to this already super shitty situation.
Hi everyone, Let me start off by saying that last year I left my fiancé due to me not being able to deal with her depression. I came back after a week and realized that I should be there with her but she was broken since she cried for so long and even thought about suicide. Yesterday, she decided to tell me that she’s been feeling like we’re growing apart. I asked her how long she’s been feeling that? She said for months but didn’t know how to tell me, she said she wanted to feel close again but just couldn’t get it back after I broke her heart. We’ve been together 7 years and are both 26 years old. I am a male and she is a female. Now she wants time and space to see if she can live without me and if our love is strong enough for her to come back. Do I just let her go? Maybe she has someone in mind? She did tell me to listen to a song “someone new” by Banks. **tl;dr** I messed up last year and wasn’t there, now I face what she faced.
My cat, who just turned 10 at the end of September, was doing well health wise until one Friday at the end of September he didn't have an appetite. Then the next day he was constipated. By Sunday he still hadn't pooped and barely ate. On Monday we took him to the vet and an xray revealed a large mass in his intestines. Immediately we sought out an oncology referral, however, with Thanksgiving happening around that time, things ended up being delayed. He finally got an appointment for tomorrow (Friday), and we were relieved. He was doing well and eating again. We got him on laxatives and he finally started to poop as well. Cut to Sunday: he developed an abscess in his mouth and was having difficulty eating so we took him to the emergency vet. She gave him some antibiotics and told us to continue his pain meds. So we did. Monday went well. He ate, pooped just fine, took his meds. All was good. Cut to Tuesday morning around 6:30: he started vomiting and was so limp. I picked him up and he was coughing so much and having difficulty breathing so I tried to help him. Within 2 minutes, in my arms, he just died. I have lost pets before. I even lost my dad just a few years back. But this loss is hitting me the hardest of any previous losses I've experienced and I have no idea how to cope.
i like it when i take a nap, it’s the only way i get to shut my brain off for a few hrs. it’s so disappointing when i wake up, tho. i guess this is why some ppl do drugs/get drunk/ sleep w a bunch of strangers??? bc they want to shut their brains off? i think i finally understand it. i once read in a book that the older u get the harder it is to get lit (by lit i mean Happy) and u get caught in loops n ruts n stuff, for years. for fuckin years. decades even. and then before u kno it you are dead. like i know life is short and our memories wont matter bc we will all be forgotten, but the price of oblivion is suffering for years (by that, i mean the Remainder of ur life) youll experience it despite it being temporary. youll feel it anyway lol.
Everything has been going great this past couple of weeks. I met this girl and she asked for my snapchat and we hit it off and started talking quite a bit. I really thought she was interested in me and had been flirting with me here and there. Eventually I grew the courage and planned on asking her out on a date, with homecoming coming up in a month. Before I could ask her, she basically hinted about something that inferred I was gay and she was surprised when I was confused. After that she told me that she had thought I was gay for the entire past few weeks and she sort of just stopped talking to me, probably realizing that i was actually into her. fuck :(
I had a MMC end of July and had to have a D&C. Dr. checked afterwards with a scan and said all looks good and cleared out and later said that the test results off "the material" show all was taken out during the procedure. This was 5 weeks ago and I've been bleeding, cramping (like contractions) on and off again for the past 5 weeks and passing some tissue/clots. Finally got to see my doctor today for a follow up and turns out there is a bunch of tissue left and they have to do another D&C! I am so upset. Upset about having to go through a loss, about my body, the lost time as i was hoping that we could start trying again in September but now I'm just left numb of having to go through this procedure again. Sorry for the rant. I just really had to vent to someone who actually understands and really no one does unless one has been through it themselves.
so. i've been really, really understanding about everything. i have said and done some things that are out of line, but i'm working to make amends. so, i think the least you owe me is to even pretend like you care. i really feel like we talked about this whole "communication" thing, and you promised that you would try harder. and yet, here we are, two days later: i only get to see you for a half hour, at one in the morning, and the very next day you're unresponsive again because it was more important to go on a date with your toy. you're with him again today. i'd tell you to go fuck yourself but i'm sure he's already doing it for me.
Don't get me wrong, my family is amazing and I love them. But does anyone else ever deal with anxiety after talking to their parents due to some minuscule comment? Whenever I talk to my dad, he asks me if I'm saving money and even though I am, just the fact that he asks me makes me think I need to be doing more. I'm a college graduate in no debt making $15/hr in a job related to my dream career while trying to get on track to go back to school. I have a good amount of money saved up, and a boyfriend with a great job who's constantly telling me to be less frugal and that I can buy things and enjoy life. But everytime I talk to my dad, the question comes up and my anxiety makes me feel like I'm not doing enough. Does anyone else have this? Also, any ideas of what to do? I know my dad isn't meaning to make me anxious so I don't want to bring it up to him.
I don’t hold grudges, until something like that happens. It’s been about four to five years since I’ve actually bothered to make friends. Me and new people I’d meet would hit it off for like four months, and then afterwards I’d cut them off completely. I don’t want to go into details but basically this girl in high school stabbed me in the back, knowing full well I was suicidal at the time, and I’m still struggling to get over it. I still struggle with the anger I still feel since high school, even though it’s not as bad as it used to be. She had the audacity to try and befriend me a year and a half after twelfth grade, which made me feel even angrier. I go through phases where I have flashbacks and I get homicidal ideation when I think about her a lot. Should I get therapy or anger management too? My temper has gotten a lot worse over the years too. There are times where any perceived rejection or dishonesty would make me blow up and make me take things out of proportion.
I do really want to git gud at programming so I often give it a go and look some tutorials then I give up. It's like when it's too much I just snaps and wants to scream like an autist like fucking shiit and rambling shit. I have no Idea why it's like this, I give up to easily and can't think rationally about it, I can't accept things and want it to blame on other things. I can't think clear and just wants to scream, anyone can recall in my situation or am I just nuts? I know that's it's hard to recall with this little of information but I hope someone can get anything out of this.
&#x200B; So I'm (m19) a sophomore in college and she is a junior (F20) and we are in the same volunteering service club. We have talked on different occasions, mostly just friendly conversations about school and stuff. I recently followed her on Instagram and she accepted the request, but didn't request to follow me back. Should I try and go after her at all, and If I do how should I do it, talk to her in person, try to start a conversation in her DM's, etc. I just don't wont to make things awkward if I go after her and she isn't interested because we are both really active in this service club together. I'm probably overreacting but guys what should I do &#x200B; TL;DR: Followed girl on Instagram, she didn't follow back, Should I go after her or No.
People just don't understand, they don't even try to. I don't get it, everyone thinks they are so compassionate, but when it comes down to actually being compassionate they run away. "Get over it", "You're doing it to yourself"... blah blah. Then one day they experience real suffering and they realize how stupid they've been. But of course they forget a day after. I was always very empathetic of other peoples problems, ESPECIALLY if I didn't understand them (logically this is what is supposed to happen, right, or am I crazy?), I took the time to understand their experiences and sincerely try to help. But when I try to get anyone to help me with my anxiety, or even just to vent/talk to them, ALL people eventually just don't care or think its stupid, even if they don't directly say it. I seriously mean that 95% of the people I've met in my life have no idea how to deal with mental/emotional problems, or don't even try. It makes me so fucking mad, because even as I kid I had the logic to understand basic things like empathy and compassion while others are selfish or tunnel-visioned piece of shits. Anxiety and panic attacks could be so much more bearable if I had someone who could at least TRY to understand. Know what I mean?
Hello all. I'm running into a lot of issues lately with regards to anger. I've always had a really short fuse and an irritable temper, but lately it's gotten a lot worse. I have a really hard time not sounding genuinely annoyed when people make me repeat myself, or raising my voice. I'm having a hard time keeping my composure as of late. I live with my family, with my my grandparents to be specific, and I always feel terrible when they ask me to repeat myself and I start raising my voice almost on instinct. I try to run it back but the damage is almost always done. I'm a teacher; I teach in the private sector, which means I usually don't have to deal with much frustration at work, but lately a lot of students have noted that I seem quick to anger when i have to repeat myself too much, or when students joke around too much with me (which they only do because I try to make them feel comfortable around me and I myself get really jokey during classes). Not only does this really worry me on a personal level, since I just don't want to be that kind of person, but also from a professional point of view this could severely damage my career. I've never dealt with this before and I don't know what to do or even how to begin to address this, so if anyone (especially in particular any fellow teachers) has any tips to help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.
I recently joined Reddit and I didn't know this was a thing. The title is basically about my anger that seems to come back. Anyways let's get started. Also on phone so sorry about the Grammer. I can't really describe this. I'm trying to think of the words it's just hard cause I don't want to go into the whole background thing. But at the same time I have to. But I'd feel it be better if it went in another post in another subreddit. So I might as well make it brief then. I am the youngest of my family. And as I was growing up I used to be abused by my dad and it recently had been more into verbal abuse. But I grew a skin and learned to ignore them. But it's when I feel overwhelmed. I just burst into anger. I mean yeah I defend myself from them but still I can't help it. And I am peculiar. I don't punch or anything it's just silence. And if it's extreme let's just say bodily harm. So I recently came into a relationship and we have our fights. I know it's a regular to fight but recently it feels like it's every little thing. And I really don't want to end up being an man enraged at everything around him and hurt everyone. I have another problem and that's that I speak faster than what I think. So I tend to say hurtful stuff almost every time. I'm trying to keep my mouth shut but I'd still like to get some help in my anger. Because I'm more afraid of it taking over my whole life.
We made the decision to put our beloved 15 year old calico down today. She struggled with health problems these last few years. She even recovered from a dog attack two years ago! She loved chasing moles & eating whipped cream. She looked & behaved so young. She always had a sparkle in her green eyes. During the worst years of my life, she was there for me. Any time my mom & I would have a really bad fight, she would put our cat in my bedroom. I’d hold her and feel better right away. I wouldn’t be who I am today if it weren’t for her. I don’t know if I would even be here today if it weren’t for her. I am so lucky I don’t live with her anymore. I cannot imagine what my younger brother and mom have to live with now. Seeing her fur. Her favorite blanket. Her favorite places to sit and sleep... just not seeing her anymore. Two days ago, I finished finals. I don’t like to think of her mystically, but it’s as if she chose to be ready while I had no added stressors. It’s my favorite season. I think I would want to go out towards the end of it too. I love her so much. Please, if your cat isn’t lactose intolerant, feed them some whipped cream tonight and hug them for me. I don’t know why I feel like she was going to live forever.
I want to preface this by saying I've always had a short temper, but I feel like it's gotten a lot worse over the past few years. I'm seeing a therapist, which has been helpful to a certain extent, but I still have my moments like this.... &amp;#x200B; I'm at work and there was a BBQ event outside on the patio area. There's a line of people waiting to get food so I get in line and a few people get in line after me. A few minutes later this guy cuts in front of me because his buddy is there. Didn't acknowledge me in any way. Just cut in front like he had the right. I wanted to say something, but I'm at work. There were so many extremely violent thoughts going through my head that basically ended with him in suffering/dead (if Minority Report was real, I would be arrested already.) &amp;#x200B; At the end of the day, it really isn't a big deal. The food wasn't even good. What kills me is how people can do shit like that. People who think they're special or that they can get away with something because they think they can. At some point, an example needs to be made because people won't change until something extreme happens and maybe not even then. Anyways, rant over.
I dont even know why im typing this but i need to rant somewhere. I've dated 5 girls my whole life and each ended poorly in a different way and each relationship changed or effected me greatly one way or another. Some were long distance but my most recent one was an ACTUAL relationship. we met each others parents and everything. we fought too much though so i said lets take a break and ill fix myself and come back a better person. after 4 months on a break she found a new guy. she said all the love she had for me was gone. she said the was nothing left. i know i broke up with her but i meant it as a break. this is the first time ive been broken-up with and i cant take it. she was helping my depression and then for her to leave me
I'm angry because I can't get over this these toxic feelings over someone. I've been in love with this person and time and time again, I can't get over her. It angers me because I can't and I feel like a dog chained to a post. When I make my escape I'm lured in with treats and I'm then tied in again. I get so angry at the fact that I can't love someone else without her being there in my head and I want her out. I don't know what to do. I feel so infuriated and it makes me want to cry. I just want to know that I'll be over this. That I'll be over anger that has poisoned me and just made me angry. I've made a new Instagram, changed my number so she has no way of contacting me and there's more to this, but I genuinely needed to vent this out or I felt like my heart was gonna pump so much blood that'll I'll pass out.
hi I’m writing this because I am very, very insecure about my penis size. I know that I’m not necessarily ‘small’ (6.8x4.9) but I’m very insecure. Basically I came out of a long term relationship, became very depressed and became addicted to porn. Seeing all those camera distorted penis’s made me very very insecure about my own size. I feel like I’m too thin! Even knowing that my girth is average, and therefore 50% of guys will be thinner and 50% thicker, I feel like I’ve got a thin dick. I think the issue stems from my length, I’m quite long and I think that just adds to the illusion. If I was 5.5-6 inches long it would look thicker? I just feel really insecure and I don’t know how to stop feeling this way. I’ve been complimented on my size, given girls multiple o’s through piv but I still feel very very anxious whenever I think about my penis and having sex. I know it’s sounds stupid but I’m so insecure for no reason! I’ve literally declined offers for casual sex because I’ll start feeling anxious. I don’t know what to do !!
Boyfriend is a combat vet who just gets angry at nothing. There is no physical violence, but the attitude is always negative, hateful, and just bluntly mean demands. While it isn't directed at me ever, it is becoming emotionally draining to deal with after a few years. I am forcing him to go to the doctor as a final attempt here before I leave this relationship. &amp;#x200B; I just wanted to know, does anyone else use any antidepressant or anti-psychotics? I've read several of them helping out with general anger management due to being a bit sedating. I feel like this is really the only way to help him out, so I'd like to get some suggestions on what others have done. I appreciate the time with any answers.
I dunno if this is the right place to post this, or if I'm being bothersome, but I've been feeling really down and awful this last week or so. I've talked to all my friends, and they're just the same old convos. I feel like I'm annoying them a lot. I don't have anyone else to talk to; no boyfriend, no other friends, no nothing. My family just doesn't really want to talk to each other, not I them. Nobody understands. I've been feeling really awful and lonely, and I feel like I need to cry and be hugged and just have someone there for me. I'm already tearing up writing this. I hate myself for who I am and being so sensitive and lonely and weak and angry and sad. I don't know how much more I can handle before overdoing myself and harming myself or someone else accidentally. Thanks for wasting your time reading this. Have a nice rest of your day.
Maybe nobody will ever read this post but I need to write this somewhere and I think this is the accurate subreddit. I have had a crush on one of my friends since childhood but my social anxiety and the fact that I'm an introvert caused that I never confessed to her. We used to be good friends in our childhood but 5 or 6 years ago we lost contact. This was like that until 4 months when I talked to her, that was a success, we talked more and more and one day I finally confessed to her. The answer was a "no", I mean she said no because she has a boyfriend but she said that if she wouldn't have a boyfriend she would have said yes. That is the worst feeling that I ever had, maybe I have lost the chance to be with the most intelligent, kind and funny girl that I will never meet just because I was stupid years ago and furthermore I have to see her with her boyfriend day after day on social media, living the life that I want. &amp;#x200B; (Sorry my english)
I’m pretty anxious literally 24/7, constantly have that “empty feeling” in my stomach and am always hyper vigilant (was diagnosed with OCD/GAD) so I guess I can’t really say “it only happens when im Anxious” bc I am ALWAYS ANXIOUS... anyway I feel super off balance right now when I walk? Like I legit can’t even walk in a straight line. I’ve had a bunch of blood work done and a CT scan and everything always comes back normal, I did have low vitamin D in September but Ive been on 50,000 unit tabs for the past month so I assume my vit D would probably be back to normal by now? My doctor tells me it’s my anxiety but it’s hard for me to believe him even with all the negative tests when this keeps happening to me, please tell me im not the only one who goes through this.
I [17M] am crushing on a girl [17F] from my high school and I'm starting to think that she might have some feelings for me, too. We are both seniors. I have a class with her twice in a row every other day. The other day we had gym class first block and had some chitchat, I'd maybe even consider it a small conversation. After gym ended I put on my nice clothes (shirt, tie, watch, dress shoes) since I had a wrestling meet that day (tradition to dress up on the days on meets). In our next block class, I often give her quick glances because I never want to get caught staring. As I was giving her a quick look I noticed she was staring at me. I said what's up and gave her a head nod and she asked me if she could fix my tie. I said of course, cause who wouldn't? I though about it all day after. Does this mean anything? I've never dated anyone or actually really talked to another girl before. It doesn't seem like something someone who was just really nice would do. Is this an obvious hint that she likes me too, or is she just being kind? --- **tl;dr**: She [17F] asked me if she could fix my [17M] tie, does this mean anything?
Dad… how has it been a year. It’s so hard living without you I wish you were right now to annoy me about hating school or about something stupid. But no instead your not here it just isn’t fair!!! I want you, I cry for you. I wish with all my heart you wouldn’t have left, yes I know you were in pain but now that pain is all on me. There will never ever be a day I don’t think about you. I will always look at the picture of you and me when I was just a tiny baby. I miss and love you and I just hope you knew how deeply I cared about you 💔💔
Today I lost my dear cat. I was 9 when I first got her. And today when I was holding her in my arms as the vet put her to sleep she was 17 years old. Its a weird emptiness that now lingers in ones heart when something important has died. I wasnt extra close with my family but I was always with my cat. When I was 16 and moved away to live by myself, the cat came with me. She was always there. When she needed me, I was there. We had each other. There were times were we both were moody( she was as sassy as I was) but just the knowing that we still were there for each other ment a lot. Each night we still went to bed together. 17 years she was always sleeping on the bed, near my legs or stomach. She was the luckiest cat on the planet. We found her in a trash bag, in a lake when she was just a kitten. I was lost in my sad word but thanks to her I felt safe and happy. She was a lucky cat who was loved and will always be loved until the end of my life and beyond. Rest in peacr my dear. Hope you feel better in heaven. Love you. Always.
I just feel it in the most random parts of the day. I'm at work right now on break and I just feel sad. I feel lonely and drained. I only have 1 friend and she lives all the way across the country. We talk a lot but it doesn't seem to be enough. My family life sucks. That's a whole different story though. Whenever I go out anywhere it's with my sister. I guess we have an okay relationship but even hanging out with her just doesn't seem to be enough. I need human interaction but my spcial anxiety doesn't seem to allow it. I feel like I just need physical affection all the time. I desperately want a relationship but even then I question myself about whether or not that is what I actually want. Am I just lonely? Do I need just need a friend other than my sister and the 1 I have? I don't know what I need. I just hate feeling like this..
Hi all! First of all, thanks for being such a great community! I’m mostly experiencing relationship anxiety / fear of abandonment, and in general I’m very open about my emotions towards my friends. I tend to share my worries and fears with them, and they are very supportive. The thing is, besides the usual flaws here and there, my relationship is going really well. We’re both in love and happy with eachother for over 3 years now. Recently I’ve been developing feelings of guilt about sharing my own fears in regards to the relationship, as I feel it doesn’t pay honor to how good my relationship is and how much I love my girlfriend. However, my inner fears are still there and I also feel the need to share them. I just wish the guilty feeling wasn’t there. Any tips?
Last week I went to my first prenatal check up and found out our baby passed at 9w1d. I was supposed to be 9w5d. We scheduled d&c the next day. The procedure went well and I felt ok after. I’m 5 days post-op and haven’t had any significant bleeding. I barely spotted and only experienced very mild cramping a day or two post d&c. For folks who’ve had d&c in the past: Is it normal to not have any bleeding? I keep reading stories of bleeding on&off and find it odd that I’m not experiencing any at all. Makes me wonder if something is wrong or if this is a good sign that my body is recovering well. How long did it take you to have your first period? From what I’m reading it seems like it should be expected within 4-6 weeks post d&c. Is it possible to get pregnant without a period in between? This was my first pregnancy and we got pregnant on the first cycle. We would like to try again as soon as I get the go ahead from my OB. Hoping to get some insights! Thanks everyone.
I’m a 66 yo Widowed Male (3 yrs) after 35 beautiful years of marriage and 2 adult children. I’m trying to make sense of things. I look 55ish and most my friends are 40 something. I think age is only a number. Im handsome and fun. 18 months ago I met a 47 yo who I adore, have so much in common with and I love her immensely! She has 2 children (21 & 18) living at home that I treat as my own. She has had some bad relationships. At least 3. We talk / text daily. We enjoy each other. When we met she was coming off relationship 3 AND a close cousin’s suicide and was not interested in dating so she could focus on her family. UNDERSTOOD! We kept seeing each other a lot (not “dating”) and still to this day. So I guess this is a LTC (?) and I want her in my life. In 18 months we’ve only had 2 minor disagreements She isn’t dating any one else. I’ve tried dating apps. She had a hysterectomy 2 years ago and she states that she has no interest in sex with anyone. Which brings the rub, or should I say the need. I’ve kept my hopes alive hoping this might change. I’m not needy but kissing, hugging, cuddling and waking up in each other’s arms ultimately is important to me. I want that intimacy. Need that intimacy. For various reasons we’d never move in together (never say never lol). I don’t want to be without her but do I have her? Blind Love? I want a LTR relationship with her ….. not LT Companionship. Am I CRAZY?
I try so much to try and distract myself or to be someone else. Recently started smoking weed, it helped for a couple weeks but doesn’t seem to be working too much anymore. I don’t know what to do. I am super unmotivated, I do fuck all all day. I am half-assing everything. I don’t have depression or anything but the last couple of weeks have been brutal on my mental health. It’s weird because this past month or so has been the only time this year that I’m feeling like this. I guess that makes this year a good one. I feel so alone, my favourite part of the day is when I wake up but I am not fully awake. This part of my day allows me to imagine myself happy. Weed allowed me to imagine myself as happy and to loosen the guilt I carry but it’s not really doing much anymore. I don’t know who I am anymore. I am so so so alone
My SO has depression (so do I) and sometimes just falls into a slump but doesn't have a definable reason (which is 100% okay, just different than me). He usually doesn't want to "talk about it," and if he does, he just says he doesn't know why he's upset (totally understandable, sometimes the feelings just come). How do you handle the feelings of worrying about them, thinking you're the reason they're down (even though pretty sure I'm not the reason), constantly wanting to check in on them but not wanting to pester them especially when they don't have anything to actually talk about... he seems to get really quiet and mopey (again, totally okay and normal), I just get really anxious myself and I don't want to become a detriment to him or our relationship...
I have such bad anxiety when it comes to making or eating food around people. I only can do it around people I'm very comfortable with, and preferably in places I'm comfortable with. I always have people judging what I'm eating. It also doesn't help I'm a picky eater and I don't always eat "the norm" (e.g. I only eat burgers with lettuce and mayo). I'm shut away in my room hungry as heck cause people randomly came over. I'm so afraid to go make food. I always try to hide what food I have from people. I haven't eaten at a dinner table in so long, I always eat in my room. I can't stand the feeling of judgement. It's always there, I always feel like people are looking at me weirdly for my choice of food. I despise being like this.
I've been having a pretty rough couple of weeks with my anxiety. Everyone has been worried about me because I am also depressed and I am missing work, activities etc. My dad also has high anxiety and Parkinsons disease. He is a major worrier. I have tried to keep my current struggles from him bc I don't want him to worry, but my mom ended up telling him. (which is fine with me, i was just trying to keep his sanity) This morning, i get this text from him: Daddy: RU ok this am? Is there anything I can do to help you today? I instantly started crying. He gets it. He knows what I need to hear, what he needs to say and what not to say. I wish my husband could be this understanding, but he doesnt struggle with anxiety and he never will. But my dad made my day today with one simple text. He didnt have to ask for me to know he would do anything (mom and husband the same, they just dont "get it") but sometimes, just the simple act of asking is what I needed today.
Honestly xmas this year hasn’t been the same. I’m 16, and I’ve known about Santa for a long time but it is our first year not having him because my little brother found out. I think part of it is for six years I was up to the ungodly hours of the night and wrapping for my brothers and having to pretend to be surprised. I have never been big on reviving gifts so that has never been a big deal to me. I also think part is many traditions have faded. We use to get pjs on xmas eve and we didn’t, so I went out and bought myself some bc I didn’t want that to end. We die to watch Grinch all together, we didn’t, we use to bake cookies, we didn’t, we use to read a book we didn’t. Mostly I use to move out elf on a shelf for my brother but he knows and my mom didn’t take him out this year and it sucks. We are really growing up hu?
I'm headed to college in a month or so, and today while ordering dorm stuff online, I bought a taser and a rape whistle. After which, I googled how to keep yourself from becoming a victim of rape. What. The. Fuck. It took me about two seconds to realize how fucking awful that is. That I'm so scared of other human beings (if we can call them that) that I have to resort to purchasing a damned taser. How fucking awful is it that I'm scared to simply exist. How fucking goddamned depraved are we as a society where I have to google how to keep myself from getting raped because I know I'll be blamed for someone raping me. But nonetheless, I continued my search, revealing the existence of 'Rapex', a plastic device inserted into the vagina that impales the rapist's genitals with irremovable spikes. Sure enough, the comment section was filled with men complaining about how barbaric and unfair that was. They complained about how it wasn't right for us ladies to 'scar and mutilate someone like that'. They paid no heed to the exasperated women who were trying to explain how it was, in fact, fair, and if they don't want their penis impaled, they shouldn't fucking rape people. The men didn't listen, essentially saying "Rape doesn't hurt women as much as these will hurt men". What. The. Fuck. I shouldn't be scared to just HAVE a vagina. I shouldn't be scared to walk on my own, or go out by myself. I shouldn't be afraid to make friends with guys. But goddammit I am. I'm terrified. I don't want to be a victim, but I guess I am already since I'm a girl.
I started a new job about a month ago exactly. It's my first "real" job, so the stress I've felt at work lately is amplified because I want to do well. I've had good days and I've had bad, there have been times where I genuinely just wanted to get up and leave, but I didn't because as anxious as I get there's the part of me that knows I need this right now and if I run away I may never get better. Yesterday might have been the hardest day yet. A co worker asked me to do something, and after much back and forth trying to confirm what it was they wanted from me, I was still unsure. The co worker came down to my desk and seemed very openly annoyed with me. The tone she used made me feel so small and stupid. The kicker of all this is that even after this, I still am going to have to confirm with them that I have things straight so that it's done correctly. I couldn't sleep last night because all i could do was replay the moment in my head and beat myself up over it. I spent the night tossing and turning thinking about how today could potentially go. When I woke up this morning I felt short of breath knowing that I would be back shortly. How do you guys deal with times like this?
My bf (29M) and I (25F) have been dating for 6 months when I found out that he still kept his ex-gf's photos (selfies, candids of her and of them together) on his phone. They were together for 2 months. I've never snooped his phone before but it was brought up in conversation when I mentioned whether it was weird to keep photos of past partners. He didn't think it was weird because he thinks they're just memories. I don't agree with him because I feel like once an ex, he should have removed those photos from his phone where it's so easily accessible. If he wanted to keep them as 'memories', shouldn't he have kept them in a folder on his computer, or somewhere not so easily seen? I just find it so disappointing that he didn't think it was a big deal and for him to be able to scroll up into his photos and still see her there. FYI, he's not the type of guy to have lots of photos on his phone either. I brought it up to him and I know I shouldn't have done this, but I asked him to remove them. He did, but was extremely upset about the whole situation. Am I overreacting? \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : Bf kept photos of ex on his phone, should I be worried he's not over her? EDIT: They ended on bad terms if that's of any importance.
This is something I do a couple times a week or so. I'll start going through an imaginary argument in my head. It begins fairly innocuous and slowly builds while I work myself into actual anger. Sometimes I don't even notice it's happening and I'll spend 15 minutes pacing around my house having this ridiculous fantasy argument. I'll realize what's going on, feel like a psycho and wish I hadn't just wasted my time basically day dreaming. I go through it in meticulous detail, replaying the satisfying parts over and over again. It feels like venting, it's somewhat cathartic as long as it doesn't go too far. I guess I'm posting to see if anyone else does this.
FB messenger came out with sharing days. I normally post something stupid, nothing really related to what I'm doing that day. Someone messaged me at work and asked what I was up to and I took a casual picture of the lab room I was in and sent it. I then sent another irrelevant photo/meme that I recently found. I wanted to add that one to my day and there's a little + sign, but I added the one above it. I noticed it later and didn't think it was a big deal and went to change it... until I saw who had viewed it. I am friends with the owner's relatives and saw that one of them had seen it. I am freaking out for who knows what reason. Maybe I'll get pulled in and yelled at over this. I'm new so I'm really worried about first impressions. Am I overthinking this? It didn't show any sensitive information but I really don't know how this is going to go down and my anxiety is through the roof about returning to work. Would you be embarrassed/worried over something like this?
Today I snapped again at my autistic brother. Today he put a hole through the wall and broke the glass on a picture and I snapped and started hitting him. I’ve had to watch him since I was a 11 with no help from anyone but my mom and she had to go to work, so usually it was just me. I have so much resentment towards him I understand he can’t help it but I still don’t like him. He throws these tantrums every day and is constantly making high pitches noises. I’m tired and want to cry I hate him and I wish he wasn’t in my life.
(doing this on my throwaway from worldpolitics' war) I've been faced with two options recently in my life, and I'm so incredibly afraid of failure due to my upbringing that I don't know which one I should take. For my entire life, I've had something to worry about, something to occupy my mind. Recently, I discovered that I managed to literally trap myself in a fantasy that I made and believed it was reality, and due to me finally getting out of it and a family move, I no longer have anything to worry about. I'm completely fulfilled, but it feels wrong. I have two choices: I can either stay like this, live out a mediocre life like my parents but mildly better, or I can push myself to my absolute limit and see if I can do something interesting. Both options are equally appealing, but I still don't know what I should do. I'm a very bad person (sociopathic tendencies that ended up taking a toll on my mental health), but I know that I could do something great. I'm cornered with two choices, and those choices will end up deciding the rest of my life. I just feel empty right now. My entire life, I've wanted to be free of responsibility, and now that I am, it's visible to me that it's just empty and sad. So: my two choices are as follows: live the rest of my life stressed and unfulfilled but knowing that I'm doing my best, or live the rest of my life wondering what I could've done but content with what I've done. I'm not asking for advice, I just wanted to feel like I've told somebody this.
It's been a year and almost 2 months since I put my dog to sleep. While it seems to have gotten more bearable, I can't shake how I acted on that day. I'll be washing my face, driving to work, shopping, and it just randomly comes back to me and it brings me to my knees. I wish I would've handled it better but I just couldn't handle it. She got sick bad and fast. Like in the span of a week. She was losing function in her back legs, and her bowels, and what I can't stop thinking about from that horrific day was when she lost control of her bowels and then fell in it because she couldn't stand. I was the worst mess you'd have ever seen. I just remember carrying her to the bathtub to clean her up and hyperventilating and crying so hard I almost puked because it was the worst sights I've ever seen and I was losing her. I regret so much not holding it together because she was probably scared and I made it worse. I just can't forgive myself. I should've been more grcaeful in her lost moments on earth. Instead I made it worse.
It’s 12:30 am, I have to be up in 5 hours and I feel...not myself. I’m wide awake, but in a weird way. I have so much on my mind but when I try to remember it I forget what the fuck I was just thinking about. My memory is escaping me. I feel like a total sense of disociation right now. I feel like I’m empty in my head and I’m typing this just to try to remember what I was thinking 5 minutes ago when it felt like the world was crashing down. I start therapy tomorrow again. I don’t know what I was trying to achieve with this post, it was supposed to be a rant but I forgot what I was thinking about. I’m really depressed you guys. I feel like a shell of a human. Thanks y’all.
I've been in a fantastic relationship for two years now, aboslutely love him to bits. The last few months, maybe within the last 5-6, I've been getting really easily frustrated. Little things will make me go off; he wants intimacy when I don't, he asks me to get him a drink, I make dinner and don't get immediate thanks. Tiny, petty things. I hate it and I have no idea where it's spurred from. I've had some problems with anxiety due to not being able to find work. I know that if I continue it'll ruin the relationship, and that'll make me even worse depression wise. I'm already isolated. Any ideas or ways to help control the anger would be great. I've started writing a diary when I get angry and thinking things over.
Growing up was stressful. My parents fought and divorced and I was moving states constantly. I developed anxiety and depression at when I was 8. Had my 1st anxiety attack when I was 8 because my grandma was a hypochondriac and somehow she passed it on to me. Ever since, I google all my symptoms the minute I’m feeling sick. Now, I don’t mind a cold or a normal respiratory infection. My main fear is vomiting. The anxiety of getting stomach sick has been so bad that I lost 20 lbs last year and my stomach shrank cause I never ate. I started getting GERD when I was 13 cause of the anxiety. I have heartburn so often, I’ve tried every OTC heartburn medication and tums don’t work. I take gaviscon and Prevacid now. I even get heartburn when I do take both meds, no matter what. So the heartburn causes more anxiety. It’s a cycle. My point is, my anxiety is miserable, I have to take a little bit of Valium every day or else I’m afraid I’ll get a panick attack. My anxiety has fucked with my stomach so badly I don’t know if it’s reversible. I’ve seen 2 GI’s and they see nothing wrong worth my stomach, they both said it might be from anxiety and stress. I’m only 16, I feel so bad I can’t enjoy my teen years due to my anxiety and stomach. It’s hard. Having a phobia is hard. I’m taking exposure therapy right now and it’s kinda helping. I have skills to manage anxiety but my mind thinks they won’t work. Anxiety is hell, anxiety is miserable. I don’t know where I’m going with this, lol.
So basically, I only recently realized that our friendship is almost like that of a mother and son, even though we are really just friends and are basically the same age. I never realized it until recently but it does feel exactly like that sort of a dynamic. Is this strange? Should I bring it up? Or is it ok and should I just keep things the way they are? It has become kind of normal between us but around other people it does get some strange looks. Though there are no direct references to this dynamic, which is why I never noticed it (and maybe he hasn't either) it just seems like it works for us and we both naturally have it with each other. **TL;DR** Is it strange to have a mother son dynamic with a friend of the same age?
I wanted to share with you all that I have finally done something that it's taken me two years to finally do. For two years I have been absolutely terrified of getting a job. I had gotten a job that was way too fast paced for me and I had a breakdown on the second day and quit. Since then I have had panic attacks every time I came close to employment. In the meantime I had been taking classes and volunteering in a few places, while my mother supported me. Well, last week one of the volunteer places told me they wanted me to apply for a job opening they would be posting. It's an administrative job that I can zone out and do mostly alone. Perfect for me. I applied, and today I got the call that I got the job! And I'm only halfway terrified! I feel like I have taken a huge step. It is quite possible that I'll feel very anxious in the coming days before I start work. I just wanted to share this victory. I've faced the biggest fear I've had since spiders.
This hurts so bad... I made a post a few days ago about the doctor being unsure so they wanted me to get a better internal scan to see what was up. She looked at me and said sorry, your baby doesn’t have a heartbeat... she asked me if I wanted to see it and I said yes. I started to cry more. It’s Friday night so I have to wait until Monday for my doctors office to open back up to see what they wanna do which makes things even worse because I don’t want to be carrying around my dead child. It’s like my body doesn’t want to let go. I’ve been bleeding for days but nothing has expelled. I feel like curling up in a ball and dying 💔
Remember that Hallmark holiday that came (and went) a couple of weeks ago? I thought I survived it pretty well, sending some candy to our college-bound daughter (she sent cookies!). Back in 2008, we took a family vacation (the kids had that week off from school for Presidents' Day). Knowing that we were going to be out of the country for vday, I packed some decorations, including one that was a bunch of hearts and flowers on strings, that you would put in a doorway. There's a picture of my wife standing in the doorway, wearing a red dress that she had bought on the trip. Today, I was cleaning a random box, and found those decorations. They brought a bitter-sweet mix of emotions. Obviously, she's not here to go travelling with, or getting dressed up for dinner in a foreign country. I got some comfort from knowing that I had pre-planned something that she would have liked, which is fairly unusual for me. I thought I had made it through the first vday without her, but I guess pride does cometh before the fall - or at least triggers are around every corner.
Before you start, I will love you with all my heart and the thickest and thinnest of the white strands that make my soul if you read the whole post. Yeah, I'm having a hard time accepting a few things, I'm not in denial mind you. My feeling is more "How can this be!? This is terrifying!" rather than "This can't be. * Thinks of reasons why it can't be *." It's like there are matters and events and subjects that I'm fully aware of, I'm aware they exist in real life, I'm aware that almost all human beings do it. But it's just that I can't stop thinking about them and highlighting the terrifying things. I feel like it's foreign and unknown and dangerous to me. I just fixate and fixate over it until I edge myself into a mental gag-reflex (Many of you who have anxiety can totally guess how this feels) and go into a full fledged panic attack and lie on the floor and just try not to stop breathing. Now here's the tricky part, while all this is happening, I am constantly telling myself all the reasons why the thing I'm fixating on is (kinda)normal and common among people today, I know what I'm saying to myself are hardcore facts I myself know and believe to be true, but it's like the "Sound" or "Voice" of the fixating and panicking are just 'Louder' than the voice of reason. This has been bothering for a few months now. I decided if my life is going to continue like this, might as well end it. Because it's really a paralyzing force against my daily activities and duties.
My best friend of 10+ years passed on Friday and I’m feeling so lost in my grief. She was 24 & I am 25. We have been friends since 8th grade…haven’t been together for a while but I did see her about a month ago, and we would text all the time. I feel immense sadness and for some reason I have this weird feeling that I can’t seem to shake. My mom passed about 4 years ago and my grief was intense but seemed to come and go in waves but with my friend I just have this insanely heavy feeling that I can’t get rid of, no matter how much I try to distract myself. I could really use some advice.
havent seen my wife in a few months. shes does taxes so its largely cause shes busy this time of year. but pretty sure thats how she prefers it. good thing i quit a job i loved left friends to move to the city where she got a job. have no friends now. though its really for the best. i have no time for friends since i goto work, come home and take care of our kid, cook, clean, do laundry, dishes, get the groceries, mow the lawn, etc. i do like my new employment so its not all bad. i am worried i am a failure at it though. i was thinking about waking up early to start swimming, but my wife asked me to take over drop off duty for daycare. got no real reason to suspect but pretty sure shes cheating on me. so thats my story
I'm 22 male. For some reason I'm very emotional lately and my default emotion is anger. The last three days in a row I've just been walking around shaking and twitching because I'm so mad. I try breathing exercises and they don't help. I don't understand how I have the energy to feel like this everyday I'm usually laid back. I eat right. I exercise intensely everyday. I masturbate daily (no girlfriend). Nothing helps I just keep getting really mad. I know why I'm mad. Because I feel like my life is stagnant at the moment and I want to get moving. No matter what happens with my life the logical thing would be to calm down so I can actually think. But instead I just keep more angry. Any techniques to calm down
I have had awesome professors full of real-world knowledge and experience who treated me respectfully. They recognized that we were adults, paying to be here, who wanted to get out into the world and have a job. They responded to emails promptly and professionally. They didn't make me feel like a burden when I needed some extra help. but then there's... *inhales* THESE FUCKING ASSHOLES WHO HAVE BEEN IN ACADEMIA THEIR WHOLE GODDAMN LIVES AND THINK THEY'RE FUCKING IRREPLACEABLE EVEN THOUGH THEIR LECTURES COME STRAIGHT FROM THE TEXTBOOK WOW I AM SO GLAD WE HAVE STRUGGLED FINANCIALLY FOR 4 YEARS TO LINE THESE PEOPLE'S POCKETS. Fuck college I should have gone to trade school. Side note I really am grateful to my mom for helping with tuition and I know I'm very fortunate for that. It's the only reason I haven't dropped out, honestly. I want to make her proud. But its so damn hard when I'm getting dicked on time after time for just wanting to do well. I hate this bullshit.
Quick context, I quit smoking weed 13 days ago cold turkey so I’m still in the withdrawal process of quitting. I’ve noticed it has made my anxiety a lot worse nowadays or my anxiety bouts are pretty crappy. I’ve been dealing with anxiety for around 9 years now and it has never made my throat feel like it’s swelling up before, it’s weird. I know the withdrawal symptoms are making it worse probably, but I’m just concerned it’s happening now out of the blue. I can feel my anxiety start to come on in my chest, then my throat sort of dries up and feels like it’s closing inwards a bit. I try slow breathing and drinking water to keep hydrated and that helps it calm down for a bit. All day today I felt fine and my throat felt fine because I wasn’t really anxious today except tonight. I know anxiety can cause the throat swelling sensation, but has anyone else experienced dry mouth/lips? I feel that makes my throat freak out more, it sort of causes more phlegm to form and I gag sometimes.
So, usually im all good. I actually really like my life. Im surrounded by friends and family that care about me. I care about them too. I dont really have much to complain about (not trying to "show off or anything btw. Sorry if it seems like that) But recently ive felt kinda down. My best friend and I Dont really talk much anymore (complications. We didnt argue or anything, its a long story) So ive kinda felt alone since we stopped talking. It sorta got me thinking about the future. Im epileptic, so ill never be able to drive, or drink. Fuck man i cant even use my phone in bed. It makes my life so restrictive. I'm also questioning my sexuality at the moment (asexual) so thats really stressing me out and has been for months. Just a lot of stress right now i guess. Ill be okay though. Sorry, just needed to vent lmao.
My 13 year old little sister took her own life in October. You read that right. Thirteen. I found out today that she didn’t shoot herself in the head. Which means she died a painful death which somehow makes everything 100x worse. And, it also makes me question if she meant to do it or not. I wonder if she just wanted to get severely hurt. She’s never tried before (that we know of) which makes me question why she used something that almost has a 100% success rate? She didn’t leave any notes. And if you knew her, you know that if she knew she was leaving us, she would’ve left everyone a long note. I can’t stand these questions. All I want is answers. Answers I know will probably never come. This all feels like a dream still. If she didn’t mean to commit suicide, I fucking hate my mother for making this so publicly about suicide then. She’s even started like 5 fucking hashtags about it. She always has to make everything about herself. (Feel feee not to respond to this last part, just a little rant)
I worked with him last summer and found him to be my first friend at the workplace. He was very nice and visited my desk often to chat, messaged me online during work, asked for lunch every now and then, and was generally pleasant to be around. I had no issues with him then. When I left the workplace, I expected our friendship to fade away but it didn't. He continued to message me and ask if I was in town to hang out with him. At first it was fine, but the increase in how much he wants to hang out with me became too much to deal with. Every time I've been back home from college he has asked if we could hang out together. Recently he's asked three times in one week. Whenever we did hang out, he would ask to extend our plans (for example, if we were getting lunch, he would ask if I had dinner plans later that day). I have mentioned my boyfriend multiple times yet that doesn't seem to curb his advances. He is also dating and I've asked to meet her before, but he's never entertained the idea of us meeting. I think he's a good person, but despite my subtle hints he continues to annoy me. What is his deal and how can I tell him to simmer down a little? --- **tl;dr**: Clingy ex-co-worker wants to hang out all the time. Please help.
The title describes it all. I’m a very kind, sociable individual for the most part, never fighting or any physical altercations. However when I am alone I can get real angry when I have no business being angry. For example. Every morning when I leave for work I feed my two cats and put them in their room (fairly large room) because they eat our plants and get sick and it really upsets my SO because she loves those plants. The other morning they would not go into the room, you know how cats are. I was just so furious, I was just kinda yelling to get the anger out and I threw a plastic cup like on the floor but it made me think I may have an issue. Of course I would never ever hurt another being in anger but I felt like I could have handled myself better. I was just worried my SO would be mad at me if the cats got into her plants. No my SO isn’t abusive in any way but I did have a very abusive upbringing and my mom had anger issues so maybe that’s what’s causing this in me. This felt mostly like a way to vent so thank you to those who read it and if anyone has any advice please let me know..
i feel numb, i had to make myself sad when my parents came to tell me about their divorce, i feel empty, i tried cutting myself but i can't bring myself to do it because my parents will get upset. whats even worse is when a family memeber makes ma angry i immediatly think of killing myself and blaming them in my suicide note. I also want to come out as bi to my parents but my dad is extremly homophobic. Oh and i hav lots of sexual trauma that included my older brother seducing and raping me, me oversexualizing myself, me fining porn at 6 years old, me being absolutly hypersexual and tell poeple evrything about me. I feel as if my life is a buildup to nothing, i really want to end it all bc i dont think the human life is worth it. oh btw im 14
I've dated two guys in my life. The first one was completely wrong for me, but I was still happy. We dated for less than a year, and throughout the relationship my anxiety would make me worry as to whether or not I actually loved him and wanted to be with him. I eventually succumbed and we broke up(which tbh was probably for the best). I thought it was just with him and how different we were. But I've been dating my current boyfriend for a year. I love him so much. I actually think he's my soulmate. He's the male version of me, and we get along so well. I can't picture my life without him. But the feelings keep coming back. They last a couple weeks or so then go away for months then come back. I know it's just my anxiety, but I still hate them. Then I get anxiety about whether or not it's not anxiety. He knows about them and has promised he'll stand by me. This is the worst it's ever been. Now I'm starting to get stomach pains which I don't even know if they're from the anxiety or acid reflux or something. I want them to go away but I don't know what to do. I'm not on medication. My mom doesn't believe in anxiety medication. I think I'm out of options.
G'day everyone. &#x200B; I'm in a conundrum! I've posted this to an Atheism subreddit as well, but I'm expecting the replies there to be quite bias. &#x200B; I've recently begun seeing a girl, and everything is going very well. It's only been a short amount of time (\~1 month or so), but my feeling is that this could turn into something quite serious. We get along amazingly and there is serious attraction. The issue- she's Catholic. &#x200B; Up until very recently (last night, in fact), this hadn't really come up. She knows I'm Atheist, and I know she's Catholic (I've met most of her immediate and extended family, who are all Catholic as well). Last night she asked if I would ever consider going to mass with her. She considers her faith to be an integral part of her life, and particularly, family. I vehemently said "no". It kicked off a long, winding discussion on whether we would ultimately be compatible considering our very different views on religion. &#x200B; Am I setting myself up for failure here? Should I dial back my beliefs to smooth over a potentially relationship-destroying conflict? There are many things about Catholicism that I honestly despise, but she is quite modern and open-minded in the context of her religion (e.g. is fine with gay marriage, pre-marital sex etc). &#x200B; I'm no stranger to church (in my profession I attend many services and commemorations that involve a Christian aspect), however attending church for the sole purpose of worship is something I'm really struggling with. &#x200B; I'd really appreciate your advice. &#x200B; Thanks, &#x200B; Touchstone &#x200B; \--- \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : She's Catholic, I'm Atheist. Do I relax my beliefs for love?
I lost my dad two weeks ago and I am having a really hard time. He was my best friend, and I know that is common, but he was my only friend. Literally, now that he is gone. I don't get calls, I don't get rando texts, nothing. I am officially no longer important to anyone but myself. My mom is gone, my grandparents on both sides are also gone, and I have no siblings. It is really heavy to navigate through my world right now. I heard a new song by his favorite band today, and I wept. Wish things were different, I guess I'm just lost guys. & I hate not knowing how to feel.
I just lost the best cat I have ever has. She was truly my baby and the most loving, friendly soul. She suddenly had a heart attack and I rushed her to the vet, but it was too late. I had to put her asleep when all I wanted was to take her home. I really don't know what to do. She was my everything. Always in my lap, always with me. I raised her from 4 weeks old and didn't even get 8 years.. I haven't stopped crying in 4 days.. barely ate or drank.. just feel numb and like there is a void. Please any help I'll take..
I am currently having my third recurrent miscarriage ( a chemical in October, MMC in December and another MMC this month, March). I know my OB is going to guide me well (his wife had several miscarriages) but I wanted some advice on what I can be doing on my own. I am down for whatever I need but in my normal routine, I try to choose natural (makeup, paper products, food, etc) and have a bit of a witchy instinct so I’d love any advice on things like acupuncture, herbs, diet, hydration, yoga. Does anyone have anything that helped beyond their doctor? Thank you.
Examples of bad things that makes me rage to have a headache. * When I see the smoking person near me. I hate people who smoke because my respiratory organ might be weak. * When politicians do something wrong. * When stupid media broadcasts how politicians do wrong instead of how the politics is. * When my mother forces to listen to the bad history of my family. In fact, my father used to have another wife before my mother became my father's current wife. The woman did many mean things to my mother to make her have mental-illness. * When I hear something bad on my region via news. For example, the fact that there are many people who are needy, the fact that there are too many mother to be possessed to the smartphones in order not to take care of their children, and so on. * When I lose the competition. I seriously like to win the competition, but I am too weak that can win only a few times. I need to know how not to rage very easily, in order not to cause headache.
4 months since I lost my soul mate. she was a gorgeous, perfect black cat, and the love of my life. I will never get to pet her again, fall asleep with her, or wake up to a new day and have her here with me. it's unbearable. we had almost 12 years together. it was not enough. i was at home most of the time, with her, and I really liked it here. it was a home because she was here. i was always looking forward going back home, to her. I dont think I know how to exist anymore. It literally feels like I have no home any more, and every day is bleak and empty.
I don't understand. I just felt the impact in my seat. *thud* *thud* *thud* *thud* this guy is BELOW me... how is this happening? I'm feeling a great deal of anger in this bock of flats. just earlier I had to adjust my other neighbours door closer because she couldn't walk through without it slamming. LOUD. She was happy for me to do it btw. I'm trying to be constructive, but I am feeling I am being bombarded from all sides all the time. I need to move from here. but in the meantime... I need to do something. figure something out. I just felt like throwing my computer at the wall.
I’ve been off testosterone since March 14th I originally went off because my lower voice had started to freak me out a little and make me uncomfortable I went on because I hated/hate having a uterus. I am in talks of hysterectomy right now which is so exciting! But I am feeling so weird and down reminiscing recently I’m back home and I’ll drive by old places that I used to be so excited to go to as a child and I feel emotional and numb. I couldn’t cry when I got sent home from college. My ex of two years had broken up with me and college was ending early. It was very emotional but I could barely cry. I had to literally force myself. Not crying felt gross I needed a release. I’ve started missing my ex after not doing so for forever, I feel numb, I don’t experience much emotion or joy or anything. I can’t feel anything, my sex drive is down, I’m numb, my emotions are in a weird state. Is it because of hormones? Is it not being on testosterone for a while? If I take a shot of it will it change? I just don’t know. I’m tired all the time but am taking more meltatonin gummies than I should as well as unisom every night
My fiancée and I had been arguing quite a bit today and out of anger I told a friend I was going to start looking for somewhere to live. She say the text and was understandably pissed. Currently on the couch , she's in our bed. I'm somehow got her to stay here tonight. I've apologized and said it was done out of anger and I regret it. I could never leave her this women is my everything yet here I am feeling like ass on the verge of loosing my best friend praying she'll even come home from work tomorrow.
My brother and I really doesn't have a great relationship. We fight most of the time even though we're both adults (he's 21, I'm 23). We clash most of the time. However, there are times we get along. We bond over food and games. That's practically it. He's supposed to embark on a ship last year because it's his chosen career path but it was postponed. This year, he was supposed to go on again but because of COVID-19, it was also postponed. The past few days, the agency he's with is made him go through all the procedure again - medical tests, contract signing, and a swab test. He kept on saying he's gonna leave soon but I kinda ignored it because we're still on a lockdown. I thought I still had weeks. Or days. Imagine my shock when I heard awhile ago that he's supposed to check in tomorrow. Right now he's packing his things and I was in shock for a while then was in a bargaining moment with him where I told him that maybe tomorrow's agenda is just a meeting. I had already cried for more than 2 hours and it just hurts that my baby brother will leave tomorrow and be away from us for 6 months. I'm not used to it. I'm used to the fact that he's always there. He might be someone who goes out a lot but he always comes home. I'm sad. My head hurts. I'm not even used to showing affection to him. I don't want him to leave but he has to. I know we don't have a great relationship but I'm gonna miss him so bad.
First time posting on here but looking for some guidance. I’ve been dating my gf for 4 years now and I knew from the beginning that she has anxiety, sometimes to the point where she’ll lock up and struggles to associate with people. Over the 4 years I try to give her little pushes to make some progress but she is starting grad school soon, has a lot of college debt, and I’ve never seen her so worried about the future (I fully intend to marry her). I need some advice on how to help her through this. I want her to get over her anxiety and only want to give little pushes to prove to her that she can get out there on her own. Any advice on how to make progress would be appreciated!
I'm currently on 5mg of Lexapro, but my doctor said that after a while, I may want to increase to 10mg by taking a second pill. It's been a month and I'm still having problems with my anxiety so I decided to increase my dosage last night. Since taking the second pill, I'm even more anxious than normal. However, there's no problem that I keep flipping over in my head. I'm just "on edge" if that makes any sense. I remember that when I started on Lexapro I had this spin up time where my anxiety worsened, am I going through that again due to the increased dosage? Has anyone else experienced this?
Maybe its just cause I'm young (M14) but I feel awkward whenever I talk to girls, I look around me and all my friends seem to be fine and talk to them regularly. It's makes me feel bad about how pathetic I am and like I'm missing out, should I be concerned or just leave it for later. PS. I'm definitely not gay or anything (not that it's bad) I just feel really nervous and get a lot of anxiety when I think I should be trying to interact with them. Should I be pressuring myself to do better with my social life or just let it sort itself out over time, very confused
It’s been a month. My mom was in her 80’s and had a number of serious medical issues. I spent eight months taking care of her. I have four siblings. Some were helpful. Some were less than helpful. But I’m not blaming anyone. Everyone has their own situation and everyone had a different way of handling this nightmare. Like I wrote, it’s been a month since she left us. And I put my life on hold for over eight months. I don’t feel like moving back home (across the country.) I’m paying rent for an apartment I haven’t lived in since December. I don’t know why I can’t bring myself to leave my parents house. My siblings and father are all handling this in different ways. I’m not judging them; I realize everyone has their own process. What is bugging me is being asked to do certain things, things that are too expensive, things that will make me sad, things I don’t want to do. I feel like saying “no, thanks for offering but I don’t want to do that…” should be enough. But my family has never been very good with boundaries. I’m sick of everyone telling me “mom would want us to be together.” Or “we’ll pay for it; that’s what Mom would want.” Or “your mom would never want you to be staying at home feeling sad.” How does anyone know what my mom would want?! Everyone has a different relationship with their parents. I’m just sad, angry and broke (quit asking me to do things I can’t afford after I didn’t work for eight months!) And quit acting like I should be fine OR I should see a therapist. It’s only been 30 days. Let me grieve. That’s it. End of my family rant.
So one day I was going to lunch and I see my girlfriend walking with this new guy, i dont think much of it at the time. So when I come back to the schoolyard at the end of lunch I see that both of them were sitting under a tree together presumably for the entire lunch.(1 hour) So lunch ends and she sees me and says hi and introduces the guy. Then she walks away with him, which left me a little hurt. So the same day we talk it out and I tell her how im hurt that she hung out with a new guy when I asked her to the day before to hang out. She says she's sorry and that she would never cheat on me, I believe she wouldn't. The thing is one of my friends saw her with the same guy after school. She did tell me she was gonna do homework with her friend but not that it was the guy. So I text her whats up and she doesn't respond for like 3 hours. She then says she's going to her moms and doesn't respond to further texts This probably sounds like dumb teenage stuff and it really is, but im hurt even though I know nothings happening. I just want someone to give me some advice on what to do/think --- **tl;dr**: I'm jealous that my girlfriend is hanging out with a new guy but i know she would never do anything.
i was just talking to my friend hanging out w my boyfriend and having a normal night… i live in a different state because i’m in grad school and a police officer just knocked on our door and came in to tell me my mom died from a heroine/fentanyl overdose…. didn’t even know she did drugs like that. my dad died four years ago almost to the day from the same thing. my relationship with my dad was nothing like my mom. i just don’t know what to do. am i supposed to go home? plan a funeral? i am 25 but i don’t know how. my baby brother lives in a different city and he doesn’t know yet and i’m supposed to sit here and wait til the cops are able to reach him. i just am in shock and have no idea what i am supposed to do next.
I'm a 19 year old male asking for advice on how I should tell my friend (female 20) that I want to date her and be more then friends I have strong feelings for her but did not act on any of them as we hanged out in the same group and I didn't want to change anything between us. Last year she moved state to goto college and that was when I felt I lost the chance to tell her how I feel about her but I just recently got accepted to the same school as her and will be joining in the fall (not because she goes there) now I see a chance to rekindle those feelings this past month she has been back in town only twice both times for a few hours as she was only waiting for her next plane and to spend time with family, we spent most of the full time she had there together and I see signs that she likes me too. I'm just scared of losing that friendship if she doesn't share the same feelings like I said we would be going to the same school and I wouldn't want to make anything awkward because of this. TL;DR I want to date my female friend of two years how do I go about it any advice/opinions will be helpful. Thank you
This is hard to admit, and I'm terrified to admit it, but...since I got my dog, she's made my life magnitudes better, albeit more expensive. I'm a helicopter dog-parent and obsess over keeping this cuddly 65lb sweetheart safe, happy, and healthy. Problem is, I'm not happy with myself, my job, my life. I keep it cool at work, with family, friends, and generally around people. But sometimes when I'm working with my dog and she decides to just straight refuse to do what I'm asking (small things like, "speak"), I sometimes snap and it's like I lose myself in rage. It scares me. Worse though, is I don't just scream at my dog, I sometimes grab, drag, through, and I've even had her in a choke hold before. It's one thing when you have to man-handle a dog to protect them from themselves (she's leash reactive to dogs, so I've had to drag her away from situations before), but it's another when they're cowering. I...the truth is...I'm abusive. Straight up, physically abusive to my dog. I'm ashamed of it, and tonight was the worse that I've ever lost it. I don't understand why I have this switch in my brain, and it terrifies me! How could I ever have kids, or a wife, or hell, even my dog if I can't control my rage!? I'm scared and I feel like I've got this ticking bomb hidden in me somewhere. I don't know what to do. I love my dog, I really do! But...am I ever going to get a grip on this? Or am I going to completely lose it one day and seriously hurt my dog, or even someone else?
I feel like this everyday. I am a total loser. I am fat and ugly. People tell me I can lose weight, but it is easier said than done. I am 22 years old and really have no friends. My only two friends are gone. One killed himself and the other moved far away. I want nothing more than a relationship. My dreams haunt me. I dream deep dreams where I am in a relationship with a girl, and the feeling is absolutely amazing. Only to wake up and see it was just a dream. I am just so lonely. I feel like no one wants to date or be friends with me because I am fat. Just ranting a bit. Hoping someone could listen and not poke fun at me for a change. Thanks.
Hi I’m currently dealing with the situation of my father being close to death He’s suffering from multiple medical issues and is currently being kept alive by intubation and medication And to make it worse I can’t even be there with him due to covid I hate being put in the situation where I might have to pull the plug on him because I don’t want him to die alone or me let him die when he might want to fight more I’m also about to turn 30 but I don’t feel ready to live in a world without him I feel weak and lost for not having the courage and strength to face these things head in without breaking down
I've only been having 1 good day per week lately, and it's getting to me. I keep waking up to gloomy skies and I can barely take it (and it's not even November, yet). I wake up feeling OK and within 45 minutes I just feel like I have nothing to do (I don't), but I DO wanna do anything. I want to get out of my fucking room but I'm too anxious to go to the coffeeshop where all the local college kids go. I couldn't even make it to the nice bookstore that smells like coffee and has cozy chairs because my Klonopin is making me WAY TO TIRED. I was out and decided to drive home like the loser I am. Just got back home and am so sleepy and sad. I think I'm just going to sleep as much of the day away as I can. I haven't felt this bad in a while.
I know I am not alone here... but I feel like this singular symptom if relieved would help my overall anxiety immensely! I tend to spend more time worrying about when my next anxiety or panic attack is going to happen, rather than being calm and enjoying the feeling of not being so anxious... The worry alone then makes me anxious and leads to higher stress levels and a more taxed CNS. This constant state of stress is what is keeping my anxiety around... I am going to really work on letting go of this worry ... wish me luck. This is going to be a battle with myself to keep those worries at bay. Does anyone have any tricks or tactics for reversing this pattern of thinking? I have tried some cognitive behavioral techniques in the past but I think I need some new ones... I started this morning by laying in bed and listening to a guided meditation to start the day... Really focused on my breath and calming my mind to begin my day... Giving this worry the what for! Good luck to all of those out there fighting this same fight... we can do this!
My dad passed away on Christmas Eve last year from a long battle with lung cancer. Since then, I've done so many things he'd be so proud of, and I'm upset he isn't here to see. I got a promotion at work (50% pay increase! He'd be so happy for me) that I never thought I'd get and I'm about to pass my last class for my degree, which I'd put off for almost two years because I didn't think I could ever learn calculus- But here I am, doing it, I've even got 100%s on some quizzes. When the owner of my restaurant told me about my promotion, and when I got my first 100%, my first thoughts were about how I couldn't wait to tell my dad. I still think that way. I'd always come home from work and tell him about my day, and he'd always ask me what I learned that day (even when I wasn't in school, because he was a true believer in life long learning). When I graduate in the winter, he won't be there for it. When I get married some day, he won't be there for it. Sometimes, even when I've just had a really great day at work, I end up going from feeling great to crying in my car because my dad isn't waiting at home for me to tell him about it. It's just hard to celebrate things.
I cry every day. I've cried every single day for months now. I lost my father many years ago, but I never went through the grief process. I wouldnt allow myself, and now that I'm an adult and I know I have to let him go, now that I know I won't be with him until 3 life times from now.. it's unbearable. Once I start crying, I have to beg myself to stop. Repeatedly. It'll go on for hours. It gets harder every day, I can't stand to be around these people (my family) whenever I look around and he's not fucking here. At least not physically. I have no idea what to do or where to go from here. I journal him, I talk out loud to him. I tell myself the truth now, but every time I tell myself the truth... The pain is unbearable. I become over whelmed with pain, sadness, also fear. Someone help me please.
So I posted up here over a month ago about my now ex and I. We got into a massive fight over her phone and her relationship with her daughters father. I never wanted to stop her daughters father from being in our lives but she would message him non-stop and have really personal conversations with him. Fast forward to now. She’s moved out and gone. When she did first move out, I took back some things that I bought her. She wanted to start an online store for crafts so I bought her a cricut cutting machine and a surface tablet to help her start on the provision she worked on it and really tried. Well, she had been making things for the ex so I decided she wasn’t getting them back. It was childish to take them but after seeing all the things she was making him, I can’t bring myself to give them back. Now, we have zero communication and it hurts. She recently had surgery and I have no idea how it went. I’ve tried to find out but can’t get an answer. I know I need to move on but it’s tough. We both screamed at each other over the fighting but now she’s just gone and it’s strange. I honestly feel like I may have lost my soulmate over this. What I want to know is, does anyone have tips on moving past her? I feel like me holding onto her is now affecting my relationship with friends and family. TL;DR - can someone help with tips to stop thinking of an ex partner as a soulmate?
This fear is really gripping and is a recent development for me. Occasionally, I get overwhelmed with this realization that a week has already gone by, a month, or a year. I think, "Wow, where did it all go?". I think of memories or things I have done/seen and just feel melancholy about it all. This is getting more common and I need it to stop. The other fear/anxiety I keep getting is about family members growing older and knowing I won't have them one day. Obviously we all die, I know that...but I can't seem to get past thinking about it. It's been happening when I go to bed each night, I think about death and get sad. Thank you for any insight/advice/anecdote you might be able to provide.
After losing my brother I came home CA, I moved to WA 3 years ago because I felt like I’d didn’t have anything for me going there. Since moving I gained a lot of good job experience and even got the opportunity to buy my own condo all by myself. But now I would trade that all in to go back into time and staying home with my brother. Being here with my family and seeing my little cousin older just made me realize why he never wanted to move. I bumped heads a lot with my family when I was younger because I was really stubborn and didn’t understand a lot of things. Now that I’m older I see why certain times we had to do certain things but as a kid I was selfish and didn’t understand why. My little cousins are fuckign awesome. I remember when they were babies I was changing their diapers and now they’re making fucking tik toks and forming full sentences that are funny as hell. I’m feel extremely gulity and angry with my self for being so selfish. My family was sad when I was leaving but I left anyway. I wish I could back in time and stay home so I could’ve been there with my brother and family instead of leaving. It’s been a week with out him and it’s so hard. I hate myself for leaving him, I feel so selfish
I'm going to be honest, a part of me deeply enjoys the feeling rage. Whether it is because I feel wronged, or am angry at myself for something I did, or it is some flavor of self-righteous anger. It feels good. I sense that there is a lot of power in it - rage, anger, fury, etc. The problem is that even though it sometimes feels good to be soaked in it, it becomes useless like that. It is like being turned on and not being able to do anything. This is not to say I would like to feel angry all the time, that would probably be wrong for me. I want to transmute my anger into something good for me and what I want to do, can anyone recommend techniques or something to read?
Today, I went to see the OB who did my D&C three weeks ago (MMC at 12 weeks) for a follow-up. I specifically drove to a town 30 mins away to see him because he was the OB at the hospital who did the D&C and I was really impressed with how gentle, sensitive and reassuring he was. I've been almost looking forward to this appointment because I really felt like it was the last step in the miscarriage process and that after this, I can get some closure and look forwards to a hopeful future. Unfortunately, I didn't get that closure today. The first thing he said when I walked in was, "So, you had a baby recently?" and I just burst into tears. Throughout the rest of the appointment, he was so fast and brisk and I felt like I was just annoying him by asking him the questions I have - most of which I did from behind the curtain while getting dressed after the US. It was just such a disappointing experience and even though I feel like I've been managing and coping well for the past week, I feel like a scar has been reponed and everything is fresh and painful again.
he seams to want me to do all of the work in the relationship and also does not care about my life and whats happening to me, i got kicked out of my collage (end of high school) and im trying to get back in but when i tell him i can't talk cause im having a phone call or a meeting i'll get a message saying "don't you love me?" or he will spring days on me with out any notice like today he wants me to go to the major city in our area that costs me 30 t0 40 pounds to get there and then he expects me to pay for food and shopping because "a man takes care of what he loves". i can't take much more of this but i can't have a go and tell him what hes doing is wrong cause hes got ADHD. TL;DR my boyfriend things all i should do id what he says.
Literally just got my dream job. Working environment seems definitely non toxic, company and job are perfect... But I'm freaking the fuck out. Every time I start a new job it takes a month, sometimes two months until I feel totally laid back and relaxed around people. I've been hyper aware of the impressions I'm making, how I speak, whether I smile at people as I pass by... It's terrible. I feel like I'm walking in the spotlight and performing. It's only my 3rd day. I always feel anxious when I don't know yet whether I can trust people so the anxiety manifests terribly. Maybe this is because I had very terrible/traumatic experiences at past jobs and the job before this was one of the most stressful I ever had, (I cried atleast every other week bc of being verbally abused or overwhelmed by clients) but I hate this feeling and don't understand it. I'm happy. I'm over the moon. So why so much fucking anxiety? And this is on meds too. :( Granted I have a lot going on right now and have had many changes this year but it just sucks being the new person again and having to reacclimate into an environment.
I felt really insecure about my looks today. Just like, “ehhh... this is as good as it’s gonna get.” And normally I don’t really feel that way but I’ve been going through a lot emotionally and it shows on the outside. At work today, a random customer (I work with people / coffee) told me I was really pretty. I am still floating on a pink cloud from that complement. The bottom line is, I know I shouldn’t search for positive affirmations from others, but sometimes all it takes is a kind word from someone to turn everything around. I’ve truly been inspired to be more generous with complements and lifting others up. I’ll never know what affect it may have on someone! 💕 it could make their day. Also, it gets me outside of my own head. Just wanted to share my positive experience and possibly inspire someone to share kind words throughout the day.
I'm on Remeron for about 3 weeks now, 7,5mg. I have GAD and dysthimia. Remeron seems to work very well for my anxiety. The first antidepressant I tried was Seroxat but that did not work for me. Could not sleep for 3 weeks so my GP switched me to Remeron. The first night I took 20mg Oxazepam and 7,5mg Remeron and I could finally sleep.. What a relief! But then the side effects. Dizzynes, oh man. That sucked. But it went away after a week. However since I started with Remeron I have these weird neck pains and I guess tension headaches. My anxiety is now a lot better to handle and the panick attacks intervals are vastly improved. From daily attacks to once a week now. I told my GP about the neck/head aches and he said if I felt that Remeron caused the pains then I should stop taking it for a week. Not sure if I want to do that.. Pain is not great but the panick attacks are 1000 times worse.. Anyone else with the same experience?
My husband has gotten the kids into WWE. We have three children together. Megan [9F], Sarah [6F] and Jake [5M]. We live in Orlando and Wrestlemania was here so we decided to go as family. I'm not a big fan. I know of them because of the kids. Jake really wanted to see Shane Mcmhan, AJ styles, Seth Rollins and John Cena. He fell asleep in Randy Orton match. We had been sitting for hours at this point in time. It was getting late and he could not keep his eyes open I tried to wake him and he just fell back asleep ,twice. My daughters said he'd seen the people he really wanted to see. Which he had. He loves Cena, Rollins, Shane and AJ. I don't know how he fell asleep with so much noise. So I decided to take him home and put him in bed. The girls and my husband stayed there. He did not wake up until the next morning. My husband is giving me grief because our son missed Undertaker. My son does not mind. He's happy he got to see his favourites. He watched the rest on the WWE Netflix thing. He won't stop bringing it up as if I ruined his bonding time. He was falling asleep in his chair and almost fell of it. I'm sorry, but his rest comes before wrestling. My husband keeps being an ass about it. --- **tl;dr**: My husband keeps giving me grief about taking our son home.
So I have a lot of stories related to my generalized/social anxiety but at no point was I stuck in a situation . I got things done eventually when it was absolutely necessary . I am a doctor and doing my internship (i.e first year) and there is this upcoming really hectic 3 months rotation and I just can't push myself to go , Its just like all the energy gets drained out of me right when I'm about to leave for work and I just eventually stay in. No idea how long before I get fired. I changed my hospital ( for the fourth time ) and I still am not able to go. After changing the first two times, I took 6 months off, tried changing my habits, tried SSRIs but nothing worked and I eventually am stuck in the same situation. Even though I know that after these 3 months , I'll get some time off and would be able to manage my stress levels , but the thought of spending 48 hours with total strangers and a really stressful environment(during emergency duties) is killing me and I just can't push myself out of bed. My temper is getting out of control and I'm all jittery . Has anyone went through anything like this or any piece of advice ?
I had a d&c two week ago after my baby died at 8.5 weeks. Even though it’s my first miscarriage (missed at ten weeks) my doctor wanted to send it in for testing because she said she was shocked that it happened. The results came back today and there were no chromosomal abnormalities. The doctor said that was good news but I’m concerned. What does that mean? And how do I know it wouldn’t happen again or there’s something I need to do differently? Are there other known reasons for missed miscarriage around this time that I could look into? I don’t want to be ignorant and let this happen again if there’s a chance there’s something that could be done ahead of time. Also, she said my levels looked good throughout my whole short pregnancy
Im sure I'm fixable. But who would want a broken item anyway? Each crack more pronounced than the last, each scratch deeper than the one before. I know I'm broken but do I deserve to be fixed? Some will say "Obviously. Everyone deserves it." Why does everyone deserve it? I find that hard to believe. Maybe the problem is that deep down I know I'm never going to be the same. My old self, happy and optimistic, died. Or maybe I killed him. Maybe this is all my fault. How can I know? This isn't a suicide note if anyone reads this. Don't be worried. I just have this deep seeded feeling that I don't deserve to be happy. To be fixed. I hate myself. My physical being is deformed and probably too far gone. My mental state is warped to the point of cracking. Maybe this is a suicide note. Could be one day. Who knows what the future holds. I could die tomorrow. I could never die. God I hope not. But who knows. One day I'll know. That will be a day to remember. I fear I'll die alone. And that I'll be forgotten. That's my worry. And it's not entirely impossible. I'm not memorable. I'll never change the world. People hate me. I have friends but how many of then wish they weren't?
Hey guys, about an hour ago, my hand started to go numb and weak (this has been happening for 2 weeks now), and then I noticed my whole body had gone numb. First time I experienced numbness, I went to the doctor, and he told me it was a panic attack. This was my first panic attack, and I don’t know what caused it. Ever since then, my hand would start to go numb on and off each hour everyday. But tonight was the worse. I’ve noticed that whenever I drink caffeine, it gets worse. Can someone please help me? My whole body is still numb, and my mom doesn’t want to hear about it. 😭
I'm so frustrated, my visions blurred I've waited do long, I'm just, trying to be heard. When I speak now, I hear it, it's so harsh and unpleasant Finding it hard to verbalize, anything now, and i'm spent I cant breath. I'm turning blue, I'm saddened I've been neglected, gettin tired, I'm a mess, I'm so mad and I cant seem to figure out the path to take What choices do I have, so many lives are at stake I'm so lost. I dont know what to do It's like I built my whole life, everything, around you How did I get here? I wish this voice was never found The walls are closing in and the sky is falling down Can I survive this? I'm losing strength, theres so much doubt Help please, I'm begging you, I gotta figure this shit out.
I just enrolled in college in my country. Here it is a tradition that all freshman are hazed. Hazings consist of stuff like walking around campus on all fours, singing degrading songs about oneself really hard, having cow dung stuck inside our clothes, simulating sexual acts with female freshman. There is really very little point trying to avoid it. A few martyrs declare themselves anti-hazing and they get ridiculed and chased around campus. I'm a very justice centered kind of guy, I take this kind of abuse really badly. I can feel the anger building inside me while its happening, when I arrive at home I flay around in anger and powerlessness. I'm not a small dude, I'm afraid I will snap out and injure someone during the hazings. Not that the fucking bastards dont deserve every bit of pain I can inflict them but it does not bode well fo rmy future in the intitution. Any tips would be appreciated.
I have struggled with anxiety for years and have never tried to reach out to anybody for help. It has come to a point in which I feel like it is really impacting my life in a negative way and I’m starting to feel that I need to reach out. I’m fed up with feeling this way and have finally accepted I need help. I had my yearly physical about a week ago and when asked if I ever had stress/anxiety I said no when it is actually quite the opposite of that. This week has been absolutely terrible and I’m feeling so sick and tired of feeling this way. I am feeling ready to seek help for myself. Would it be strange to make another appointment with my pcp to talk about how I’m feeling despite just having seen her a week ago? Or should I just push that aside a finally seek the help that I need? TL;DR: Should I make another appointment with my pcp to talk about my anxiety despite just having seen her for a yearly physical a week ago?
My Brother was acting like an Asshole towards my mom, so I told him as such. His reply to me was to kill myself, and that set me off, I immediately leaped up and smacked his arm twice screaming "fuck you", and he threw a full 12 pack of coke at my head so I picked up the scattered cans and threw three back at hard as I could into his room. He then decided to throw one down the stairs and it broke, getting coke everywhere. I'm so angry I'm shaking, crying, and seeing literal red I want to punch him to the point his face caves in. Mom wanted us to go with our dogs to meet our new dog and now she went alone without me or him because we're both disgusting fucking pieces of shit that deserve to die.
It may sound odd, i don't know if this is something that anyone else gets. I'm a 22 year old guy, i can't say I've had a bad life, I've been through some shit but I've always had people that care about me. Life has never really been how i want it, always had anxiety lingering (has gotten much worse in the last couple of years) and I've never been truly happy. Any time that anything slightly goes to plan in my life I literally become absorbed by fear. Like now, I'm talking to a girl and she actually seems to like me, her friends have told me so (I have been single my whole life). But for some reason, as it is going well, its absorbing my brain. It's like my brain is terrified to have happiness incase one day I'm not happy again and i will know the contrast. It's like I'd rather never have happiness so that the low times won't feel as low. I'm really afraid that this anxiety will end up screwing up this whole thing and I'll end up throwing it away. She knows i have anxiety, she actually helps a lot. I'm not sure what I'm afraid of.
(Random thought in the night, so bear with me.) I've had anxiety all of my life. This means that if I went to therapy and/or if I got on medication, I'd start to live in a way that I've never experienced fully. This thought scares the living shit out of me. It's like if you had the chance to correct your eyesight after being blind from birth. You'd have to learn how to function in this world all over again. I know that it'll be worth it whenever I get the chance to finally get help, but the thought of not having that pit in my stomach and not having racing thoughts in every waking moment anymore is so foreign. Would it be like losing a part of myself? Would I mourn that part of my being? Could it even be possible to function without anxiety?
I'm getting angry at my mother. A little back story: My mother lost her husband (my step dad) to a drunk driver almost 6 years ago. She is still very bitter and depressed about the loss. She feels that even though people said they will "do whatever she needs" and "be there for her" that they weren't. She's also the type of person that thinks everyone owes her something. Backtrack a couple years ago, she started attempting to date and was taken advantage of by two guys. Both she was close friends with and thought better of them than that. So now she "distrusts men". Now to my time. I lost my husband to suicide a little over a month ago. I'm caught up in probate, had to halt the sale of my house, and am in limbo with life insurance because of the nature of his death. My husbands best friend, who is my friend as well, has been a pillar for me. He's been an angel that God has graced me with in my time of need. He's mowed my lawn, helped me move, been there for me to talk, vent, cry, etc. My mother "doesn't trust him" because of her distrust in men. She thinks he has ulterior motives. Im sorry that someone is here for me when she felt no one was there for her. But she doesn't need to project that negativity on me and my situation.
As the title says above, my partner's brother has been hospitalised with a severe pneumothorax and will be undergoing surgery in the next few days. They are looking at him staying at least a week or two. I have posted before about how, for various reasons, his family hates me. His brother was always cold and distant towards me, even going as far as insulting me in the past. But I have put that all behind, because at the end of the day, I want my partner to have a good relationship with his family. I am trying to be as supportive as I can. From helping him go to hospital and try to see him to getting food and other stuff delivered over to him when I can, to making sure I take over as much responsibility as I can to not overwhelm my partner. My own Mom passed away last year and he was there for me. Today he has been feeling particularly down and he lashed out at me. I am really sensitive (ADHD + Anxiety + Depression) and I am always checking on him to see if he needs anything or his family need anything. We live together, so I am trying to not overwhelm him, but today I broke down when he said that I am "reaching". He has been angry and upset all day long, so I got anxious and worried. Am I reaching as he says reddit? If I am, please tell me what I can do to not be reaching. Tl;DR: Boyfriend's brother in hospital. BF got angry today and said that I am reaching
I keep feeling alone and hated. I know is shouldn't and that I have no right to. I don't have many friends but the very few I have are god damn great friends. I talk to them, see them every day, but I still feel alone. I've never had a bond with a friend, even any person, better then with the three I have now, they've confided in me and I've confided in them. They've come to me for everything from stress relief, to cheering up, relationship help, and I've gone to them when I was at my lowest, telling them just about everything I've ever hidden about myself, hell my one friend broke down in my car two nights ago after her parents began insulting her. She told me that I'm the second person she's ever felt comfortable crying around, she even said I was like a brother to her, yet I feel alone; waking up and hating myself every day. Telling myself you're not helping, you make things worse for them, why do you even bother talking to them, they probably only are just humoring you and feel bad for you, but I know they don't, I know they genuinely care about me.
Two months ago my fiancé died from cancer. He was 64. When we found out in May he has cancer, I dropped everything to devote myself to his care. He was initially given two years, but he lasted less than two months. My children live far from me, and with COVID, I stay pretty much at home. Last week I was called back to work after being furloughed since March and that helps my mind to stay focused elsewhere for 8 hours a day. I am in charge of his estate, and the stress of dealing with realtors, repairman, selling his car, selling his house and trying to get a lot of information for the lawyer has stressed me out to my top limit as well as grieving for the man I considered the love of my life. We had a wonderful 2.5 years together, traveled a lot, even to Europe, on my bucket list. I just am not coping well with my grief and then the immense stress.
So here's the story. My cat Simba was one of two of my only friends until second grade. Yesterday was my 2nd day of 7th grade. It went pretty good and when I got given my dad broke the bad news to me. That later today we were going to put him down. I just lost it and started balling my eyes out. When we got to the vet we went into a little room Simba(my cat) was laying in a bed. They said he has a tumour in his stomach that is too bug too remove and the best thing to do for him is to put him down. We spent about w hours there petting his giving him hugs and kisses and crying. When it was time we said our goodbyes and went out to the car my mom stayed back with him when he was being put down. He was only 6 so it so sad to see him leave so soon. I cant stoo crying and missing him, in fact I'm crying while typing this. I wasnt ready to say goodbye to him. When we first got him we told him never to get sick early in life and that he will live a long, happy, healthy life. But here we are and uo there he is. I will never stop missing you and loving you. Rest in Peace Simba✝️❤😭
Hi everyone, i've been meditating since the past august, it helped me so much in every aspect of life and i learned something important: sometimes it's important to give up to our inner resistances so to let the thoughts to come and go. So when i think about anger i think about a particular moment where i do have to let go my inner disease to avoid it to burn my mind and my soul, but i see a lot of people who tend to have frequently burn out moments who tend to feed their anger, so in this case we don't have the necessity to free ourselves from anger but we feel the necessity to put the anger in the first step by feed it. Sometimes i can't see the differences between those two aspects, how can i distinguish between the moment of a good outburst and the moment where i feed the anger? Thanks for your time
This will be a pretty short story. Basically, I've been dating my boyfriend for 2.5 years. When I first met him he wasn't out to his family or his friends and I knew this going into the relationship, and waited patiently for him to come out. He finally told his family, and things were great. At his current job, he tells me about a coworker of his who constantly uses the f word in front of him, and my boyfriend does tell him to not use the word, but not because he is bisexual himself. None of his coworkers know he has a boyfriend, and when his coworkers ask him what he did for the holidays, or where he went on vacation/did for the weekend, he never mentions me or that he did any of these activities with me. His reasoning is that "they're not my friends" but I tell him all the time that when my coworkers (who I'm not friends with about 95% of) ask me what I'm doing this weekend, I never hesitate to say, "I'm doing ___ with my boyfriend". It's never a second thought. I've brought this up with him so many times, but his reasoning is always "they're not his friends" but I know he's just too insecure to tell his coworkers he's bisexual. I feel I don't deserve to be a secret, and I don't know what else to do to make him realize I shouldn't be. Any advice? --- TL;DR: My boyfriend won't tell his coworkers about me being his boyfriend because he's insecure about his sexuality. I don't want to be kept a secret, but I don't know how else to get this message across to him. Any advice?
I'm not diagnosed with anxiety but I always have been anxious in my life. Last Saturday I had a really bad panic attack for the first time in my life and I thought I was going to die. I've had one almost every day after that and when I'm not having a panic attack, I'm freaking out and getting really bad heart palpitations. I just don't feel like my old self. I haven't been eating properly aswell as when I eat j food I feel like it's gonna make me have. A heart attack and I start panicking. I've gone to A&E and they cleared me saying my heart is in good shape and I'm healthy but I still feel this way. Just need some advice and help really
Long time lurker. I recently started to try to actively try dating with Tinder/Bumble. I was getting some solid swipes (I'd maybe put myself at an honest 6.8 look wise) and I eventually planned a date [21F] I was super stoked about at a local brewery on Tuesday only to get stood up. No show, no text reasoning. Sucks but ok at least I have Thursdays date [23F], right? Well Wednesday night rolls around and I get a text from Thursdays date saying she won't be able to make it. Feels bad man. Never felt more undesirable. It's really hard for me to put myself out there so when I try and this happens, it's definitely a big bruise on the heart/ego. I was so excited. 2 different dates in one week is kind of unheard of for me and it was actually a big confidence booster at the time I "landed" those dates. I guess I just wanted to vent. Maybe get insight on how you guys deal with feelings of low self worth specifically regarding relationships. **tl;dr Had two dates cancel on me last minute this week. Want advice on improving self worth.**
**tl;dr** Wife has suspicious lump. Doesn't want it checked out, says it's natural and that she is ok with it ---- ---- Wife [late 40s] has lump in right breast that continues to grow. Knew about it a while back, assumed after she initially told me (and reason she told me) months ago that she was having it looked at and with no updates I figured cyst, etc. Other items like growth under eyelid and discussed and taken care of. My fault for assuming and not following up. Family has history of cancer, including breast cancer. Recent doc appointments for kids (boy, girl, pre-teen), she mentioned it and they said "get in now" and I whole heartedly agreed. She says now that she doesn't think she wants it taken care of and that its "natural", that she always knew this would happen and she's ok with it. Our relationship as a couple isn't the best (long story there), but day to day, adult life stuff (house, bills, kids, work, fighting zombies, etc) is generally equivalent to others our age. Her reaction worries the hello kitty out of me. It doesn't seem rational (and I know thats not a good thing to say to ones wife). Tried discussing, getting same reaction which is no action. Really tempted to reach out to close family members (and since family has history of breast cancer they know this stuff) for help on this. Am I overstepping if I do that? I thought I would tell my wife I was going to do it - field objections and then do it anyway. Seems so heavy handed but also that it's appropriate to recruit help. Thoughts?
I am so sick of living with my dad. I'm 18 and live in the bay area. It is impossible to live on my own on a minimum wage job. I am in a family of 5. Everybody including me hates my dad. I have no fucking idea why my mom didn't divorce him a long time ago, but I guess it's too late because she hasn't found a job for years and I think it's because she lost her pharmacudical license, which she probably does not tell me. So I guess our only source of living is because of my dad, according to her. &amp;#x200B; All the years tolerating his verbal and physical abuse towards my mom. Yes, I call out on his shit when he does something shitty, but nothing FUCKING CHANGES. There is no hope for him to change, all I must do for the next 7 years is wait patiently until I graduate college. I want him just to fucking go away and leave me alone, I don't care if he dies or moves out, as long as he's out of my life. &amp;#x200B; The only option may to move out of state, but this would be a last resort option I wish to not pursue. I don't want to have the feeling I'm abandoning my family with him if I ever move out of state. And it would take time to get my own car to even move out. &amp;#x200B; What the fuck am I suppose to do? Yes, if my whole family were abusive, I would leave no matter what. I want to fucking leave but I don't want to abandon my family except for my dad. How do I just go on with this shit?
My neutral state is sadness. I don't know what this means and it's probably just summer blues because there is no significant event that's making me feel this way. I just get sad whenever I wake up from a sleep and I don't really have many friends in my area which I don't like either (as it's far from all my other friends). These days I just don't want to do anything or talk to anyone to the point where I need to move to another room the minute my parents come back home but I'm alone nearly all the time so shouldn't I want human company? Idk what this is, just putting it out there I guess, hope everyone has a good holiday :)
So this might be not as serious as other posts here but I do need help with this. I am a 14 year old boy with aspergers and I play allot of this game called destiny. I love both Destiny 1 and 2 so much and I get really angry over pvp. When I get killed in a stupid way or lose. I will smash my desk and my expensive keyboard which makes me even more angry because I don't like doing that because my grandpa bought it for me. I deleted the game from anger tonight. And sometimes it escelates to me hurting my self like smashing my leg and punching my head etc. It really affects me around my family. Seeing keycaps all over my desk makes me feel really mad for ripping keys off something I care about allot. So anyway I just want to ask for some tips to control my anger. Edit: Thank you for the tips everyone I really appreciate it.
I was diagnosed with that big word right there. Also, Depression. I can't find a group for that. On face book I can but I don't know. They seem to be about moms with bratty kids. I am a man and have no kids. I am not sure this diagnosis really fits. It sounds like you get mad for no reason. I usually have a reason. But, what ever. I am going to a therapy class but would kind of like some online help and a group. I think people with mental illness should get all the help they can. So, hey everyone.
I’ve known this girl for 5.5 years, been in love with her for 4. We’ve dated other people in this time span but I always find my way back to her, thinking in my head it makes sense. We know everything about each other, have hung out countless times alone, and have had several drunk hookups. She recently suggested we date on the foundation that we know each other inside and out and there’s mutual attraction. I obviously said yes. After a week of talking and hanging out once she says it feels to platonic and that she loves me as a friend but she can’t feel it right now. I honestly feel like a fool letting myself agree to date and being so optimistic about it. It was like a dream come true. Now I feel like I’m losing the only relationship I’ve wanted for years and I also don’t know how I could stay friends with her after what feels like an emotional betrayal. I would constantly drop anything for this girl and have gone above and beyond to be a good friend/boyfriend in the short duration we dated. She had brought up meeting my friends and doing couples costumes and other future events, but I feel like she never let herself really open up. Now I’m here wondering what I do with myself and her. So besides drink beer in bed while watching Netflix, where do I go from here? TL;Dr; best friend of 5 years suggests we date. I obviously say yes, she says it feels to platonic and ends it. What do I do with friendship/relationship.
This isn't something that should really bother me at all.. but for some reason it just shattered me. I play piano and it really is the love of my life, but in the last year I found myself enjoying it less and less and saw playing it as a chore. Today I played a piece that I love and found myself in it again. It was the best I'd ever played it and I was so happy. Then my grandma walked past and told me "I think you've lost your touch". I'm sure she didn't mean to hurt me at all but for some reason I just broke down and burst into tears. It really wasn't anything, and yet here I am, sobbing my face off. :(
My SO and I have been together for a year and a half. I truly love him with all my heart. He's absolutely amazing. We do a ton of stuff together, have similar interests, spend most of our time together. He's absolutely my best friend. He's my first real long term relationship. We've talked about kids, where we want to live, he's met my family, I've met his. The problem is that lately, our relationship feels a little bit different to me. It seems a bit more comfortable. Less sparkly and less oh my god I love you so much and more comfortable and secure. I don't know if this is what's supposed to happen or if it means we're falling out of love? The idea of losing him makes me sick to my stomach but I keep coming back to the fact that our love feels different then it used too. Is this normal? Tl;dr: love my boyfriend differently, what does this mean.
So when I got a PlayStation this year I was pretty excited about it until I had to get ps plus to play online which used to be free for ps3 not the only that but the whole discounts and free games are bullshit because the the games with discounts are usually something the most people wouldn't buy and the free games aren't free for two reasons one I had to get a subscription to get those free games and two when your subscription ends the games are locked so those free games are really just rental games Nobody doesn't want to fucking pay a subscription to play online to access games that they bought with their money.And it isn't just Sony doing this Microsoft has been doing this since the days of xbox360.But PC platforms like steam online play and deals are free to anyone so the only things you pay are the the PC and the games.
I live a lie everyday i wake up knowing its the same thing everyday and every week and month im just so tired and i want to go home i have multiple people come up to me every day and ask the same question its annoying my parents never understand my hobbies or never care about what i do the only time they care is when im doing bad in school or when im popular and jump in and steal everything from me they have taken my friends from me, my laptop and creative hobbies, and ability to feel happiness im so lost and i dont know what to do im just in a spiral of destruction right now and i dont see a way out the only way i see is death and i just want to go back home. . .
It’s been over 3.5 years since you died. Some days are easier than others, but the last few have been especially hard. I loved being married to you. You always had a way to make things better. I am glad that you are no longer suffering, but cancer took away everything and now my life is unrecognizable. Lately it’s been difficult for me to get out of bed. All I do is think of our life together. I miss our little family. How do I do this without you? Do I live the rest of my life just hoping to die soon? I have nothing to live for. Please hear me Steve. Please help. I’m running out of options.
Growing up, the only friends I had were unreliable, and only "friends" because they were there and we were bored. In Secondary School, I didn't get on with anyone because if I didn't like them I said it right to their face, and if they told me to say it again and watch, I did that too. I didn't fit in, so people didn't like me. I didn't understand at all how to relate to those people at school. But then, at the end of the last year I met a girl, who became my best friend. My friend, she..well, she's the only person I've felt like I could connect to. She's similar to me in some ways, but she's a much better person than I am. She's sarcastic, but just enough. Funny, but not snide or insulting. She can make jokes easily, or join a large group without worrying about it. I'm sarcastic, but come off as cruel, I can't make jokes, people think I'm insulting them when I'm not, and I have trouble with people I don't know or large groups of people. She's better than me in any way I can think of. But...because of her I was able to move on from hating the past because I finally had something I could remember with a smile. I was able to develop as a person because she helped me. I've considered her my only true friend for some time now, though I never said anything. And soon she's going away. I don't want to be alone again. I've been alone. I don't want to go back.
We had been dating for about 6 months when she told me she needed some space. For 2 or so weeks we didn't really talk and then we started to chat and hang out again. Things seemed to be getting better until she broke up with me yesterday. She was really nice about it and despite me trying to find a solution, I accepted and we parted ways on good terms. She said that she just didn't want to have a boyfriend right now and it was nothing to do with me. Just in our time apart she'd changed her thinking and her outlook on the world and wanted to be single at the moment. I'm 18 and she was my first girlfriend and I feel completely heartbroken. I can't stop playing over all the good times in my head. It's like a depressing greatest hits reel. I loved her so much and I know it's cliche and a little lame, but i just feel empty inside.
Everyone in this life is just searching for attention, and if they don't get what they want then they hate on those that do. So if you don't like what I have to say, I could not care any less and I don't give a single shit. All of your petty troubles, all of the words that you stifle, all of the rage that you put on display will just get you knocked out. All that you're choosing to do is to bring everyone else down, so while you're talking shit about me, I choose not to see. Your words just hit deaf ears and there's nothing that you can do to stop me. if you wanna tear this place down, wait around, I'll just put you in the ground. There is nothing you can do, to stop me and what I do, so while I wait for you to lose your cool, I'll look back upon your vocal stool. So when I come alive, and all your voices start to cry, I'll raise my middle fingers to the sky and scream fuck you.
We tried long distance and it didn't work, I had suspicions he was seeing someone on the side (never been the jealous type) and although I couldn't prove it...his lack of interest in coming to see me and constant excuses really confirmed that this wasn't headed in the right direction. He passive-aggressively says he wants to keep in contact but is very dry and his demeanor changed and I guess i was friend-zoned. I cut him off for a few months to gather myself and start talking again, not really looking for a future or anything, just to talk. At first he seems hurt that I cut him off. BUt gets over it quick when I stop responding to his bs. Then progressively gets sweeter and nicer and talking to me nonstop (constant messages in 15 minute increments and tells me where he is at all time..things he didn't really do before). If a future comes up, he says things like 'You'll find a great guy' but doesn't want to give me advice on guys im seeing. He brings up the past like good times and confesses that he still goes back and looks at our pics.... i don't. (too cringe-worthy) Says he'd like to have a beer with me 'one day'? Is this a guy thing ooor this some way to manipulate my feelings so I stick around and entertain him...if so why bother? --- **tl;dr**: What is going on? I'd just like a little insight on this guy.. or men in general lol
I've known her for over a year, we have a lot in common. She was my best and only friend, as in I've never had others over and been over to others' houses nearly as much in comparison to my relationship with her. We both enjoyed each other's presence and shared everything that was on our minds. I was really happy to be with her, she really gave me motivation to finish my college work and take care of myself. And I thought things were really looking up compared to before I had met her. But then she decided she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore and it hit me like a train. I don't understand why she felt this way and I probably never will, but absolutely nothing lead up to it. She said things would be as normal just that we would be friends, but I've only gotten to see her outside of college maybe 5 times in the past 6 months. Things aren't at all the same. I couldn't enjoy this summer at all, and I'm still suffering. She believes we're still regular friends as always, but I have such a hard time acting normal around her now. I feel like crying every time I message her, because I know things won't go back to like they were in the spring. She knows partially how I feel and wants to talk to me about it in person, but I really can't. I know I'll get over this eventually, and I know this may be how every break up goes, but man am I ever feeling down. I wish this would pass so I could go back to enjoying activities again without having to think of her.
Adult male, early 30s, living in NJ. I've had mild anxiety since my teens. Gotten worse last several years, more severe panic attacks, sweating, heart palpitations, inability to focus on what I'm doing at times even speak coherently. Its taking its toll on my professional life. Currently I've been unemployed/uninsured for a year plus. I'm curious about out the process of getting treatment. I'd prefer medication and not therapy/counseling. Something I take only when expecting a anxiety inducing event and not something requiring I take it daily. Again, I'm pretty clueless about this stuff, I have tended to limit, extremely, my dealings with doctors, the health system in general even when warranted... anxiety and all. The more I know what the expect I think the less anxious I get and hopefully can follow through. Like can I walk into a clinic, tell my tale and wak out with a prescription, get it filled... pay a few hundred bucks total? Thanks guys
Sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom I’ll get a strange chest pains (not indigestion I’ve had that before) it goes always shortly after, I just had a doctors appointment early this week and my heart and blood work came back fine they also done an ekg and chest X-ray which was also all good and he prescribed be busbar. I just went in for the chest pain. I realize you guys are not doctors but do any of you guys get these strange chest pains upon waking up? Edit: I described it as chest pains but it hard to describe it doesn’t actually put me in pain more like a feeling of general discomfort and a warm sensation through out my chest. I wouldn’t really call it painful
I had been friends with this girl since junior year of high school and we were very close then and throughout college. However after I graduated I no longer vibed with her for many reasons. As we grew older I realized that she was still doing things that I would consider childish. All she wanted to talk about were her many guy troubles and how dudes treated her like trash. I would offer advice but she wouldn’t listen and still deal with them. At one point I think she just liked to complain to me about it. I just got tired of her blowing my phone up with texts talking about the same things. I prefer my friends low maintenance. She would get mad if I didn’t text back in time or if we didn’t hang out every other day. One thing though...my personality is much more serious than hers. She’s always so happy go lucky (which is why I loved her) and I’m always ridden with anxiety. But I guess I expected her to grow up eventually and not be so all over the place all the time. I think it was finally over when I wished her a happy birthday this year and when it was mine literally month later I received nothing. It hurt, but I feel like after almost ten yrs of friendship bdays should be kinda locked in. TL;DR I ended a friendship because she didn’t grow as a person and didn’t give me the same attention as I gave her.
Hey all. I'm in a relationship of about 9 months. I love my boyfriend. I do not trust that he loves me, and it's not necessarily his fault. He's affectionate and kind to me, but there are things about him/us that make it so difficult for me (a person with diagnosed anxiety) to feel secure in the relationship. He's best friends with someone he used to be in love with, he rejected me for a year (while pursuing other people) before we ended up dating, and he's not someone who is all that comfortable with long-term commitment, which is the one thing I'm kind of looking for in a relationship. He's spending most of Christmas with that friend I mentioned right now (he's spending the evening with me), and I'm seething jealous. I've been jealous about this friend for months, and I've tried very hard (therapy, mindfulness, etc) to build some sense of trust that he'd never leave me or secretly be in love with some other guy. But I don't think I can manage it. Through no fault of my partner, this relationship has been one of the largest sources of stress in my life for about as long as it's existed. I'm sick of it -- and I don't know if I should end things due to incompatibility, or just keep trying to better. As I've said, I love my boyfriend. But I'm going insane trying to pretend I feel safe and secure and that I'm not jealous. Any advice appreciated. --- **tl;dr**: jealous and insecure personality in a relationship with things that trigger jealousy and insecurity, not sure if i should end relationship or try to continue course-correcting
I've never seen a doctor or therapist but I know I have anger issues, I am just unsure where they stem from or exactly what the issue is. I am an extremely irritable person - someone could walk into the room and it could irritate me for no reason. Enough little things build up that irritate me to the point where I feel angry all of the time. It's stupid little things always and I just want to start being able to take a step back and be like okay - do I really need to feel angry/irritated about this?. I don't know where to start. I feel like a terrible person because my boyfriend will be having a normal conversation with me and I get so defensive about everything like hes attacking me but I know hes not. I'm condescending and rude and I just want to get help.
I am an only child and my mom is a single mother. We have lived in Michigan for my whole life, but upon my graduation next fall from college she plans on moving to Florida. I have no interest in moving to Florida, in fact I would like to move out west, maybe Seattle. We get along very well, so there are no hard feelings in this situation. Is there some unwritten responsibility that i should stay close to my mother? She plans on retiring soon and I’m not sure if it would be irresponsible to live across the country from her. **tl;dr** only child with single mother, what should I do after graduation?
The woman I love (we've been together for 4 years, living together for 1 of those) celebrated her new job last night. With old friends, 2 cities away, until 12:43, doing things we had talked about doing together, while ignoring my calls. I called up my mother to talk for a while while she was gone, which only made me remember that my mother and my father had moved half the country away earlier this year and I'll probably never get to hug my mom while she's spry and healthy ever again. So now I'm just sitting in our tiny bathroom before going to work writing this while putting off calling the hospital for cancer screening for a cyst that may or may not be a side effect of medication I started taking for my mental illness. Posting here because I have no one in my life besides the aforementioned partner to tell. Hope it's sad enough to be acceptable here.
I'm just so angry that I could explode. I don't get it why people make promises to me when they can't seem to keep them. Latest broken promise involves my broken car. A friend of mine who knows a bit about cars insisted on fixing my car with his mechanic buddy. It was already more than month ago when he said he'd be ready within a week... He has all the time given new deadlines when the car is ready but it never is on that date. Now it's supposed to be fixed by Sunday morning. Why to even give a date when it's done if you just change it constantly and why insist on fixing something for me when you obviously don't have the time to do it?! And seriously, all I wanted was to take it to a real car repair shop...
Today at school it was a pretty normal day until the fourth class when a classmate who just happened to also be the clASS president wanted to take my seat. Normally I would've just let it go if it wasn't the fifth time that happened. Then he just sat next to me and started nagging me to move, I just sat there and ignored him. Then it was time for recess and we were allowed to stay in the classroom. I kept sitting there and he went to talk with some of his friends. Little later some guy that I don't know very well came to me and said that I should move or that the prASSident is going to kick my ass after school, I just sat there and laughed. They started gathering up around me. Then they started asking me questions to which I would just laughed. Then the clASS president pushed the guy I mentioned before at me, when he hit me I hit the wall with my head. I just laughed it off, at that moment I was so fucking pissed but due to my kind heart I didn't want to bust his head open so I hit the wall with all my strenght, I think I broke a bone actualy. Long story short is it ok if instead of busting a guys head off I almost break my arm? EDIT: I know it's not.
Planet Fitness is supposed to be a gym right? I mean they have cardio equipment, weight racks and heavy lifting equipment. Are they a gym? Honestly in my opinion, No they aren't. Not only are they not a gym, but I avoid them like the plague because of what they believe in. So I was doing some shadowing for them as a Janitor to see what work would be like. I noticed a huge sign with a flood light. I didn't pay much attention to it because when I ask "What the heck is that?" I was met with silence like the supervisor didn't want to talk about it. This will be important later. So I looked at their website in the title they have this "Judgement Free Zone". What could that mean? anti bullying? No. Absolutely not. The owners of the company believe that if you are judging people you are not allowed to be on their premises. What really is the case is they don't want big muscular men to come there and use the weights and grunt loudly, dropping the weights and judging others. And they use the term "Lunk" so if you are using weights "loudly" which is hard not to do. then you aren't allowed on their premises. and if you continue to do so then the "Lunk Alarm" I talked about previously will go off. I have a HUGE issue with this. Not only does it tick me off but it really disappoints me. They are the only fitness place that is walking distance from where I live. I'm stuck having to go way out into town if I want to go to a different gym. I prefer old fashioned gyms but I can't seem find any now a days.
First off, I'm very competitive at Video Games, so competitive that I cant play Ranked Matches as everytimr I lose I put a hole in the wall. I try to bottle my anger and hide from my friends and family but everytime I see them mess up I want to bash their skull in with a heavy book. I struggle to show emotion even when I try. The last time I cried was 6 years ago and that was because I hurt my ribs badly, in between that time my Grandfather died and my dog. I didnt cry once. The only time I ever lashed out was when my friend Kenny pissed me off and scarred his hand by repeatedly stabbing his hand with a broken protractor.
Update: I blocked him. It was hard, and I cried when I saw his picture again. At least now I won't see it. I blocked his number on my phone just in case. I had an affair with a married coworker about a year ago. I really loved him. He was a good friend and we became more than friends for a few months. He broke it off suddenly and told me to lose his number. I was so hurt, but I respected it. I didn't contact him. We don't work together anymore. Then he popped up as a friend suggestion on Facebook. I looked at his profile and it doesn't have a relationship status. Can I send him a message or friend him? I still miss him. If I didn't think he could have been something, I wouldn't, but I loved this guy a lot. TL;DR: I had an affair, he broke it off, now he's on Facebook with no sign of a wife, can I get in touch?
Hey Reddit 🖤 I hope you’re all doing as well as you can be. My heart goes out to everyone on this subreddit. My beautiful partner just lost her younger brother to a fentanyl overdose. They were extremely close and it has impacted her family deeply. Her siblings range from about 6 years old to about 30 years old and everyone has (of course) been destroyed by this loss. The kid was a really great human. She hasn’t experienced a loss of this magnitude before (and admittedly, though I lost my brother to his addiction as well, we weren’t nearly as close so I haven’t either). I’m seeking a few different solid books/articles to hopefully send her/her family’s way— 1. Books pertaining to her situation (losing a sibling/a sibling to addiction/an accidental overdose) 2. Books pertaining to her youngest siblings (to help them understand death/the potential of what might come after, as they of course have a lot of questions) 3. Books pertaining to her parents (of course how to cope with the loss of a child) What spoke the most to you in your darkest hour? Does anyone have any specific advice? We all explained to the younger siblings (6 and 8) that there are lots of beliefs about where we go when we pass and we’ve offered them comfort in the form of suggesting that he’s still around, even if they can’t see him or hear him. I’ve offered to help her parents in any way possible and I’m of course keeping myself completely open, available, and present for her. Again, I hope you’re all holding up as well as you possibly can. Love and good energy to all of you.
my friend died in spring of 2020, right before lockdown (i’m talking like 3 or 4 days). it was devastating and completely out of the blue. i struggled to coped with it most of the summer and i still miss him of course, but i thought i was doing a lot better. we went back to school full time a little over a week ago. i’d been all online ever since lockdown in march. at first i was really, really happy to be back and see my friends. and then i saw him. i was walking to class on the first day, and he walked past me. i couldn’t breathe. i turned to look closer, but it wasn’t him. it happened twice more that day. either i’d turn around and see that it was someone completely different, or i’d turn and there wasn’t anyone there at all. it really scares me. i feel like i’m losing my mind. i can’t stop seeing him. every single day at least three times a day i swear he walks past me. this morning while i was pulling into the parking lot, he was walking right in front of my car. it is starting to bother me to the point where i don’t want to go to school. it gets me every time. i keep thinking it’s him, keep trying to say hello, but then i remember i can’t. he’s dead. has this happened to anyone before? i feel like i’m losing it. is there any way to stop seeing him?
My boyfriend and I met while I was at study abroad in Italy. We are very much in love with each other, but I feel like the relationship won't have a future. He already has a career in Italy and I'm about to start law school and don't intend to study law in Italy. I feel like our relationship is doomed. I've talked to him about it and he just says "I don't know what the future is for us. I just know that I love you." which isn't really what I like to hear. I'm a very proactive person and I kinda want to hear "Don't worry, I'm looking for a job in the US and intend on going so we can be together." We will be celebrating one year together next month, but I'm not sure if I want to continue in a relationship that doesn't seem to have any future. **TL;DR;**Am I overreacting and being impatient or something? What do I do? I don't want to make him feel like I'm forcing him either but I just hate having things up in the air :/
I have just been to visit my family , my mum was diagnosed with asbestos related lung cancer 6 months ago . I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw her , she didn’t look real , she’s so thin , there’s nothing left, you can see every bone , she’s barely breathing and unconscious 99% of the time . I don’t know how she’s still alive , she’s more gone than here . The image of her lying in bed is burned in my head and so am so shocked , overwhelmed, horrified. I don’t know what to do , to say to my Dad , to think anything . The look of her was so bad , the lack of quality of what life she has left, the pain , the loss of dignity , I feel terrible for saying it but it’s her time , it has been her time and if that were me I would want to have gone
I swear that gut punch feeling never goes away. My father died suddenly almost two years ago at a young age, this is my second Christmas without him. I’m not sure how everyone else deals with their grief but for me I’m not one to talk much about it, I guess you could call me avoidant. I feel talking about it will bring more pain without resolution. It feels as if no one could say anything that subsides the pain I feel when thinking about all that my father has missed and all that I will never share with him. I recently had my first child and every milestone is filled with joy and pain. My father will never see him grow up. He will never babysit, he will never play with him and I will never see the smile my father had whenever he was with his other grandchildren. This time of year brings about a special type of grief that I can’t seem to ignore. I’m sure I’ll forever be learning how to cope with it.
I have had panic attacks, generalized anxiety, and mild OCD and social anxiety since I was a teenager (29 now). I was diagnosed by a family doctor and given a daily prescription (which I never took). I was also prescribed Xanax by an urgent care center, which I also never took. I have been able to get a lot of my anxiety under control as compared to how I once was. I am looking into seeing a therapist to further help me learn coping skills and other behavior modification skills. Does anyone have experience with therapy? Had it been effective for you? How often do you normally go? Also, I have an emotional support dog who greatly assists me during periods of high anxiety or panic attacks. He helps whether by laying in my lap for snuggles, a buddy to be with me, or a distraction for playing or going outside, etc. I know the online sites are scams and many people try to scam to get free airline fees for their pets, etc. Does anyone have any legitimate experience with getting a certified letter from your therapist?
I’ve had anger issues since I was a young boy. Luckily I’m a completely different person now comapred to back then but still the same anger comes back like out of nowhere. Whenever I think my anger is kept in check or I reach a point where I genuinely believe that I have improved I would suddenly get irrationally angry at something and the crazy thing is that it comes so fast that I can’t even do anything about it. It’s not that slow boiling type of anger but instead it comes really fast that I can’t help but give into it. I’ve just had a heated argument with my uncle when his son was here and now I feel absolutely ashamed of myself. He might not even come back to my house after this. How can I prevent this type of thing happening again.
Everyday I live gets a little bit worse. Everyday I feel more and more awake to how awful everything is around me. For example, I went inside a pet shop today and saw a bird in a cage. And I spoke to it and realized that it was suffering deeply. It's like it kept asking, why, why, why. It was so utterly alone and just sitting in a cage with no nest or home or trees or sky or sun or fresh air. And that is when I realized how hellish this reality is. How could I possibly be happy when there is a soul that exists like that out there?
Doctors say they’re send grandpa home for the last time and that he has only days to live. Comparing how lively and active he was to what he’s now been reduced to, it just doesn’t make sense. It’s been probably a year since I’ve heard his voice and even longer since we’ve hung out like we used to. I think I’m just not registering the situation yet because it just never seemed like he would end up like this. I still can’t fathom him dead, let alone sick, despite all the times I’ve seen it, and now I only have a few days to come to terms with this reality that doesn’t seem real. I don’t know, I feel like I’m rambling. This will be the first time I experience the death of a loved one, so I just wanted to know how any of you processed Greif/loss
So firstly I want to say that I don't want to leave my girlfriend for my coworker or anything like that, I just want some advice on how to handle this crush/feelings. So I became friends with girl shortly after I started working at this office and it wasn't a big deal. We'd go out and grab coffee every now and then and just chat during the day. But after a month or 2 I started to develop a crush, and honestly just went through this big period of guilt because I have a girlfriend and felt like having these feelings just made me a dirtbag. I saw a counsellor and they told me it's not uncommon but obviously acting on it is another ball-game, so I guess I've just accepted I have a crush since then. Also id just like to add in that I've had a pretty rough life and one of my big shortcomings is being emotionally aware, so if it sounds like this whole situation is a bit childish, I'm totally aware of that, I just have a tough time handling my own feelings and seldom know the right way to handle social situations. Anyway, not much has changed since then. Our team is pretty small so I'm in contact with her every day at work, still chat etc. The thing is I know the best way to dissipate a crush is "time and distance", but I would feel so awkward putting an obvious barrier between us just because our team is so small. What's the best way to handle an unwanted work crush? Anyone gotten over one themselves? I do have the option to move teams as well but that feels a bit extreme. Tldr; how do I get rid of an unwanted work crush?
My aunt died early yesterday morning. I feel like actual shit. None of today feels real. Last time I felt like this after my brother died I ended up in the mental ward and idk I know I’m not handling it well right now. My fiancé is helping best he can but he has never experienced a loss like this let alone as many as I have. Since 2015 or so I’ve had at least 16 close family members, family friends, or pets leave this earth. I’m hurting and he doesn’t know what to do and I can’t fault him for that. I can fault me for getting drunk right now. I don’t know how else to feel something.
My dad is in hospice care and is at home with us. Over the last few days, he's been sleeping more than ever before and his coherent moments are fewer and fewer. This morning, he got mad at me and started yelling at me because he said his medicine tasted different. It was the same medicine he's always had but when I said that he said he just wanted my mom and I was trying to hurt him. I don't understand. What do I do differently? Am I doing something wrong? I don't want him to be mad at me at the end. EDIT: Dad has been vomiting up some very weird things since yesterday. Hospice took him to their care facility to assess him better than they could at home and he'll hopefully be back tomorrow. They gave him a medication called Haldol (spelling) to help with the confusion and aggression and a counselor spoke with us about it. I am so glad to have you all. I feel like I have some understanding of things now and your comments have helped a lot. Thank you all so much.
Hello. I have had no formal visit with a therapist or psychologist so I’m going off of my own thoughts. I do get anxious throughout the week so I know that. On some nights, especially when my boyfriend is out late I get these paranoid dream hallucinations. I sometimes think there are people in the apartment and it spooks me. I also sometimes think there are random cats in the apartment. The worse times are when I get up to check - I’m half awake and then realize it’s just a plant or something. But it cause a high shot of adrenaline and panic in me. Sometimes can be reoccurring over night. What do you guys think? Anxiety induced? Thanks
This guy is the type of person that rubs it in your face when he gets it right. He usually is and won't let go. The guy that blames everyone else when he fucks up, never owning up to his mistakes. He wants to control everything, your beliefs, opinions and favorite things. He's really good at telling you what you want to hear, so he can get what he wants. The type of person that constantly tries to one up everyone over the stupidest shit. Even corrects people if he can't find a tangent to one up someone with. Half the time he tells you something, it's a lie or half truth, just to get the satisfaction of being better than someone. The guy that blows up in rage over nothing and has passive aggressive little vendettas against anyone who has done him wrong. When he's called out on being wrong, he does anything he can to wipe himself of blame even by crying and playing the victim card. This kid constantly explodes in anger against his girlfriend and his mother, two of the sweetest people ever. He's not afraid to use physical violence to assert himself when angered, not much but still too much. Pushing his sister, punching a TV over FIFA, etc. Luckily he doesn't drink because of these outbursts. He was like this as a child but he fixed it. Then 3 years ago his control started to slip and it appears worse then ever. Since 3 years ago, I don't think he's made someone smile legitimately (without half-faced lies), not even his jokes are funny anymore. It's not even anger anymore, he just transforms into a monster and is constantly bitter and doesn't give a single fuck about anyone. *I want to change back to how I was 3 years ago, please help.*
So as I grew up, I always argued with my mom. Normally a child would be spoilt, and misinterpret a mother's actions. But I feel my mom truly doesn't love me. She treated me badly, told my brother to give her money that my relatives were giving me without telling me. Sold all my games that I had (which she didn't buy) when I was younger. She basically stole my childhood from me. I always came home with medals and good grades and she told me it was shit and it didn't mean anything. She never cared. Now she doesn't even talk to me, and if ever, it's only to scold me for things that are so illogical and stupid. And she plays the mother card whenever I try to reason with her. Basically all of this really led to this big void in my heart. After a long day of helping people and working so hard there's nobody for me to love, or really want to know that I'm doing well. It feels so awful.. And I've had a few ex girlfriends who were God awful too. I got manipulated and cheated on. I am a "nice guy" but not the kind who expects things in return for my nice actions. But at the end of the day I really question if life has anything in store for me. I'm currently doing what I want, career wise. Yet I feel so empty and sad.. Sorry if it sounds like bullshit and drama but it's really messing me up. Thanks for hearing me out.
My 20 year old daughter is in a relationship with a 23 year old, they have been together around a year. She found out that he cheated on her in the past and lied about it, only admitting my daughter was given proof. He has beaten a lad up recently just for messaging her. He goes clubbing most weekends while she bearly does anything socially without him. She used to be a really confident bubbly person, but is now very insecure and her life revolves around him 24/7. She has decided to forgive him for cheating and lying to her because she says it was early on in the relationship, though I suspect it’s not the only time. --- **tl;dr**: My point is that we teach our children to be honest, so although I know I have to accept my daughters decision, should I really have to pretend I’m ok with him and accept him coming to my home? He makes me sick to my stomach 🤮
Let me start by saying I love my child. He is my entire world and I would never leave him. So this is mostly just a rant. I don’t want to be a single mother. I never wanted to be a single mother. It is so hard. And I feel like most people don’t understand. But, most people in my age group, especially who live in my area ( small town ) don’t get how hard it is. I am not divorced. I don’t have an ex. I don’t have a back up parent in another home. The only person who loved my son as much as I do, would give up anything for him, will always put his needs ahead of their own, who is as equally invested in his life as I am, is gone.The only person who remembers the day he was born, his first foray into solid food, his first steps, his first words, his first night in a big boy bed, etc is no longer on this earth. If I get sick and have to go to the hospital in the middle of the night, I don’t have his dad, or anyone, to call to watch him. If my car breaks down and I can’t make it to the bus stop after school I am screwed. I have lots of friends who are very involved in our lives and help when they can. But they also have their own families, and if there is an emergency, they can’t always be there. And I have to make every important decision by myself. I am terrified of making a mistake. This is hard. It sucks. And he is only in kindergarten, so it is going to get harder before it gets better.
FYI I'm 17. I struggle with motivation and emotional bursts and I get angry at myself for how childish I can be. I've just been in the same place for a long time, I want to get better. I want more from this life but I'm so tired of waiting until I can. Waiting constantly and constantly disappointed. I'm sick of it. I want a different life, and to experience new things and meet people! I'm tired of being the way I am, introverted, socially anxious, and childishly sensitive. Also with feeling childish, I feel that way when I get angry because I cry when I'm really frustrated. There's no good way to express any of my difficult emotions except for crying like a baby and holding onto someone who is sick of me. I want to punch something, throw things around, just anything violent but safe. I'm tired.
This is my first real post on Reddit. Tonight I've felt a mixture of betrayed, scared, sad but most of all angry. I haven't felt like this in a long time as I figured out how destructive it was to the people around me and myself and dealt with it, but not tonight. I grew up with addicts for parents and even though a lot of my childhood was happy, my dad dying with a heroin addiction was not the greatest time of my life. I share this because of my fear of addiction. Tonight my SO decided it would be a good idea to drink to 'solve' his worries/sadness. I'm not a prude, I understand that people do this, however, I couldn't just let it go. He's had a privileged life (doesn't make his worries any lesser than anyone else's) but I do get angry that he relies so heavily on me and his mother. He doesn't do anything that requires independence and it just makes me so angry that he would do something that would hurt me so much. I know I'm ranting right now, I'm sorry. However, tonight I felt my chest tense up and my throat had that sinking feeling and breathing exercises were just too hard to do. I had the biggest urge to break, hit, smash something and say hurtful things, just for the sake of hurting him. I don't want to do that to him and I don't want to start feeling helpless and out of control. I would love some advice, kind words, anything really.
So my partner and I have been wanting to move in together and plan to once both of us can afford it. Although my parents won’t get to choose whether I do this or not as long as I’m supporting myself, I am worried they will make things incredibly frustrating, awkward, and rocky (between everyone involved) by letting their disagreements be known. I can see them “acting out” in a number of ways like not helping us move, not coming to visit, or if they do visit making it uncomfortable. I realize I need to set boundaries with my parents and probably even pull away a little but how do I do that without completely severing the relationship? They can be rather dramatic if they don’t agree with choices I make. TL;DR How do I set a boundaries with my parents so that my partner and I can move in (happily) together?
My husband's family (and I) are dog lovers. His parents like us to bring our dogs over too so they can run and play with theirs. But my SIL does the same. I wouldn't have a problem with it if her dog hadn't viciously attacked both of our dogs on separate occasions. I'm scared to death of her dog but I didn't hesitate to try to strong-arm him off my dog. During either incident, our dogs were lying down resting far away from the brute. He came over and just attacked out of nowhere. No food or toys were involved. Both times, my SIL did NOTHING. She didn't do anything physically to separate the dogs and she didn't apologize in any way. She brought him over for Christmas at the parents' house. MIL yelled for her help because he was starting to get feisty towards the other dogs and she again did NOTHING. She continued sitting on the couch. Eventually MIL had to grab a kennel because the dog wasn't backing off. I hate this dog. I hate that SIL brings it with her. And I am upset SIL doesn't do anything about her damn dog. TL;DR: SIL's dog attacked both of our dogs and she still brings him around and hasn't apologized.
This is non-romantic...I've asked her out before and always gotten rejected. Though it might be worth noting that she always says "I do like you," and she's currently seeing someone. Basically, she only talks to me when she needs something and asks me for favors, but she really doesn't reciprocate. I mean that in the sense that if I ever want to talk she'll just say "well I was busy," but expects that I'll always give her a reason for something when I don't talk to her. I pointed this out and she said "we'll continue this conversation another time, don't want to talk about it right now," and then proceeded to never again acknowledge my request to talk about that. I feel a bit used and to an extent even afraid to mention how I feel about anything without some crazy rebuttal. Help me out here, pls. --- **tl;dr**: I think I may be getting used and I don't know how to proceed.
i just want to figure out what's happening to me. i used to love doing productive things like playing an instrument, reading books, sketching and painting and stuff like that. i also loved watchings series, movies and anime and i also read lots and lots of manga. but all of a sudden i stopped doing all of it. idk why, idk how. i just realized that i stopped. i still love doing those things and i would love to do it again but i just cant bring myself to do it. it's so hard to explain and i hope anybody out there is experiencing the same thing so i can talk to anyone about this. it's so frustrating. i only sketch forr like twice or thrice a month. i dont even touch my guitar anymore. even though i really want to watch anime, i just cant. same thing with reading manga. i tried buying a book that i've always wanted but it's like my body is rejecting to read it??? there are time that i plan on doing this and that but at the end of the day i ignore those plans and just procrastinate. i dont like ending stuff. maybe that's the reason? i'm too afraid to end things, like for example watching a series or reading something. i'll stop right before the ending and then forget about it. idk if that's the reason?? i just dont understand whats happening to me. i loved doing those things so why is this happening?? im sorry if im not making sense. but i hope someone out there can help me.
I made this throw away account to vent. i don't know if I'll even check the replies. I'm so lost at the moment that I just can't seem to figure out what's what. And it's not even directly about me. My best friend has fallen on very hard times. The story is complicated but she is also my lover. Again with the complicated story, she is in a very bad spot financially and needs to do something. I regret with all my being that I am in no position to help her. So she has decided to consider prostitution to get her out of the hole she is in. We have talked it over, and I'm still trying to cope with it. I'm worried that she will do it until she is caught up, and then if she falls behind, she will do it just because its an option. She does not want to do it, but sees no other choice...and I don't either. This is poorly written, not a cry for help, not a cry for support. just a cry. I'm not sure what our relationship will be after the fact. My brain can't go there until it happens. Right now, its just a waiting game to see how my system reacts to it all.
I lost my eldest brother a couple of days ago to suicide. It's so confusing cause I thought of him as the guy who had everything. He was the golden child and honestly my mother's favorite kid. We never knew of any sort of emotions he was feeling, he was a very closed off guy. I struggle with chronic depression and other mental health disorders but even I couldn't understand why exactly he did this. He left with no note, we're still unsure about the motive that led to him doing this too. It's been 4 days already and I can't process that he's actually gone. There's so much I want to say about him but I don't know what to do or how to carry on with it.
Hi, two days ago the summer vacation started, at least in my country. You'd expect that I'd be happy, but I'm not. There are several reasons, but I want to write about one of them. I am in same school for 4 years and for all those years we had the same class teacher. And here's the thing- I really liked her and there's 99% chance that we won't have her as a class teacher for another 4 years. Her behavior wasn't always the best, no one is perfect of course, but she's a good woman. Last year I told her about one of my issues (it was connected to school) and she was trying to help me. I appreciate it very much, it was really nice of her. She tried to help every time when a classmate needed help. I sometimes see memes about how teachers don't care about bullying, but she isn't like that. She always cared. When we had problems with other teachers, she always went to talk to them. I liked the way she wss teaching as well. When she was explaining new things, I always understood. This is her in general. I'm very sad that we probably won't have her as a class teacher for another 4 years, I will miss her. Thanks for reading this.
I haven't had my feelings hurt in a long time. When my depression started I stopped taking actions that would put me somewhere I could be hurt. I was this way for 6.5 years, give or take. Now I finally started beating back my depression, I've lost 90 lbs. I've started being happy during the day for no reason. I made a facebook for the first time, added all my family etc. I don't have any friends, I've been looking for ways to make some. I actually have a desire to be around people now. I saw this girl I went to school with working at a service station. She was never working the register so I didn't have a real opportunity to make small talk. We've probably never said a word to each other. I found her on facebook and added her - "Hey, I've seen you around (high school) and more recently working at (gas station) and I wanted to meet you." She denied my request and never responded. And see, I don't need anyone to tell me its irrational to get upset over that. I probably gave off a stalker vibe, I kind of look creepy, she might just ignore everything from strangers, whatever right? So why am I crying? The only time I've cried is when I was sitting on top of a parking deck deciding whether or not to jump. I don't know how to deal with this, I know it will pass but its just a new feeling for me and it hurts and I wanted some support
Lately, i have been getting angry more often and easily. If i dropped a handful of change i would pick it back up, move on. But now if I did that, I would want to punch something and start cussing. Today, I dropped my lunch on the ground and i ended up breaking 5 plates. I feel that this is because I don't have any meaningful interactions with other humans. I don't talk to family anymore since they shun me, and all my friends, or coworkers are aquantinces that I have hallow conversations with. Too be honesest, I never actually had someone close I ever talked to. Last night, for the first time in years, I just started to cry, when I thought about this. My anger has never gotten to me and is impacting my position at my job. I flipped a table today and was asked to take a week off. I'm scared I might get fired and am at a lost of what to do. Can anyone help me with what to do? TL;DR Anger is getting out of control lately and is affecting my job.
Hey, I’ve been doing ok over the last couple of weeks, had hardly any physical symptoms and felt the best I’ve felt in a few months. Till a couple of days ago felt super stressed and then my palpitations have come back as well as muscle twitches mainly in my leg and vibrating under the base of my foot and one of my legs feels super heavy, heart racing and can feel it pounding again. Avoiding googling it as I know it will say blood clot and knowing I have health anxiety I’ve had to convince myself I’m not dying as I’ve had bloods, urine, ECGs and 24 Hour ECG and everything came back normal. I know acceptance is the only way to beat anxiety but it’s hard at time with these physical symptoms sometimes. Just wanted to rant to feel better as I could burst out crying some days.
I have dreaded this day since I was a little girl. I'm 25 now and it hurts worse than I ever feared it would. I have always been a very sensitive, emotional person. It's the one thing I would change about myself. Tbh I woke up this morning and wished I hadn't. I have never lost someone this close to me. I've lost pets which hurt but never being able to speak to her again makes my chest want to burst. I feel so guilty for not calling and visiting more. Towards the end I could tell that she wasn't all there mentally. My email is linked to one of her accounts that she would order the family gifts from. She ordered me a bracelet with my name on it just a few months ago. My aunt is going to give it to me today. I am heartbroken that I can't thank her and hug her one last time. This post was more about venting than anything. I just hope that she knows how much I love her. How do we deal with the guilt? My partner (who has been so supportive & loving) always tells me that I'm too hard on myself. I'm afraid that I will never stop feeling guilty for not spending more time with my Nana.
in december it will be four years since my mom died and i still find myself pretending it didn't happen, longing to talk to her, etc. i know this is a normal part of grief, especially complicated grief, but i also recently got sober. sort of integral to the philosophy of sobriety is that you have to (or it's best to) accept reality as it is. last night i had my first dream where i knew she was gone, and i knew it was from suicide, and i knew she wasn't coming back. this is highly unusual for me. she doesn't often come to me in my dreams. i only dreamt she was dead once, right after it happened, and then i've had a few dreams where she shows up and there is no recognition of reality, she's just an actor in my dreamscape. so maybe that acceptance is slowly happening. just, the frustration and longing and sadness that follows when i realize that there is no escaping this outcome is so hard to relive almost every day. are there folks who frequent this subreddit who have accepted the decision their loved one made, even if they didn't/don't like it? how did you get to that place?
I’ve been having a rough time at work. I’m a teacher, preschool, and started in a new school. I share my class with three other teachers, this is where the problems started. We don’t share the same philosophies, I hated how they treated the children, and I felt isolated all day. They would ignore me, would question everything I did, and I just felt miserable. I tried to keep my cool, but I confronted one of them on the ignoring. Guess what they did? They ignored my confrontation. Finally I snapped, I left the room and broke down in the staff room. I told my boss I couldn’t handle how I and the children in that room where treated. I feel like a failure, she said to take the rest of the day off. Panic attack on my break yesterday, survived 15 minutes of my shift today. I should have taken more breathes. I shouldn’t have confronted them. I should have stopped myself from crying. I shouldn’t have to talked to my boss while that upset. I should have been able to control my emotions. I should have been able to avoid the attack. I failed myself, I feel ashamed, I feel like I let everyone down, I feel like a stupid piece of shit. I am drained, I don’t think I’m physically able to talk without crying still, still focusing on my breathing and not hyperventilating. I’m ashamed to tell my mom about how it went, because I need to be able to cope and I know she will be disappointed. This isn’t okay. I need to be able to not panic, to be able to function when things are less than ideal, it sucks but it is unavoidable.
I just don’t get the same feelings around and on holidays anymore, like, there’s just nothing. Everyday just feels like a repeat. I don’t get the same good feelings that I did a couple years ago. Everyday just feels so dull. I don’t want to go back to the hospital. I just hate talking and hearing my voice I hate looking in the mirror and seeing my disgusting face. I feel selfish for wanting people to like me even though I desperately want it. I hate the idea of having a funeral because I don’t want to be remembered. And just as things start going right everything just goes to shit. I don’t want to do this anymore.
Guess I’m just looking to vent a little here and gain some perspective. I’ve always had a pretty strained relationship with my mother due to her alcoholism and abuse growing up at home through my teenage years. I am now happily married and live an hour away from her. It was her birthday yesterday, and I texted her in the evening to wish her a happy one. She texted back with the middle finger emoji and said “I am so pissed off that u can’t make an effort to even make a fucking phone call to your mother.” I’m pretty upset now because we have not made a big deal about birthdays for the last number of years (she totally forgot how old I was one year and it was nbd to me). This also isn’t a milestone 50th or anything to warrant this IMO?! We spent time with her over Christmas and I told her I secured a new job (first big opportunity in my career field) and that it’s been super busy and working lots of OT. I was planning to call her either today or tomorrow to see when she was free to celebrate her bday but now I’m really unsure how to deal with it. Did I screw up that badly? Or is my mother being unreasonable? Tl;dr mother was mean after I sent her a happy bday text
Hi all! It’s been a minute since I’ve posted. In life news, I’m almost through with my grad school orientation and I’m excited. Now I have to deal with the actual teaching part. I normally don’t get stage fright but the idea of talking in front of a bunch of young college students is definitely making me nervous. I tend to stutter if I’m nervous or I become tongue tied. I also get very self - conscious about my appearance. I’d love to hear if anyone has any tips for helping with this. I hope you are all having a good day and your bad days are few and far between.
So my friend and I were having a slight bit of an argument. I brought up that people always tease me because I am in love with her in this arguement So she send me this series of messages of how's she's going to be honest and that she's "done with everything". She then sends me this: The reason they think that is because it's obvious I love you more than a friend. People see that. You may not and I don't really care because it doesn't matter. And I have no clue on how to take this. I tried to talk to her more but she sort of just doesn't want to and I have no idea on how to take that. The whole situation is very bizarre to me and I have no idea how to handle it. So any advice would be fantastic! --- **tl;dr**: My Best Friend sent me an angry message of love, and I don't know how to take it.
I was wondering if anyone else felt like this, I've been dealing with some postpartum depression so it may be amplified already. When I'm angry all I want to do is cuss out my SO or throw shit, I tend to at times give low blows verbally and end up saying some messed up things. It takes everything and I mean EVERYTHING in my power to not do this^^. Being angry and acting out your anger feels good in the weirdest way, probably because I couldn't express those emotions as a child. But when I calm down, I can no longer relate to those feelings at all, it feels like that's a completely different person. I almost feel like I'm not even capable of saying/doing those things and I'm so full of love and light, I can think clearly again and just be overall good. But then something triggers me and completely takes me out of my character, until I feel ashamed and evil. It's gotten to the point where I've legit thought I had a bad spirit attached to me because that just wasn't me, but I know that's denial. I just want to be and feel more consistently level headed.. This shits hard.
And I'm tired. I should be happy with where I am and be glad that I'm able to experience and participate in my course but I still feel like nothing is going anywhere. I want to work on these assignments and get shit done but my body won't let me or my brain will get distracted and redirect my energy into something that requires the same amount of effort or more but has nothing to do with anything. I can't read 2 chapters of a textbook but by god I can spend 5 hours editing a video, or studying a dead language, or analysing character traits. I'm young, so maybe that's why. In a few years I'll look back and think how naïve or ungrateful I am at this moment. But I want to give up. I'm tired. But the drive won't go away, so no matter how much I do want to give up I just can't. It keeps me going when I least expect it to, dragging me through the day until it hides itself for the next. Rinse and repeat. I'm just stuck in a frustrating loop of something and nothing. I've noticed that I can't properly express my thoughts into coherent words and forget simple words and synonyms which causes me to use a word that no one would ever think of using. I used to be an A student in english, what happened? Despite this loneliness and drainage, I adore the dark and sad. I surround myself in it. So why do I feel this way?
So a little background information to give it context: I fell in love with Jake while I was dating another guy, and Jake and I ended up making out. Eventually I broke up with my boyfriend at the time because I realized that I was in love with Jake. Jake had just come out of a relationship where she cheated on him and he it had obviously affected him. Jake and I eventually started sleeping together but he doesn't wan't a relationship beause he's "emotionally unavailable at the moment" and he doesn't want to screw up again. But he says he really likes me and enjoys hanging out with me, and he even got me a Christmas present. In his defense he is indeed always really busy at work ( having to wake up at 5 am to go to work), and one time he got drunk and he called me really upset saying that I'm really hot, clever, smart etc, and wondering why I was into someone like him. What do I do ? Do I wait for him or do I move on ( this has been going on for a year) TL;DR: I fell in love with Jake while I was dating another guy, and Jake and I ended up making out. Eventually I broke up with my BF at the time because I realized that I was in love with Jake. Jake doesn't wan't a relationship beause he's "emotionally unavailable at the moment" but he says he really likes me. What do I do ?

And it's not "things". See things for how they are. And, not how you want them to be. Once you drill that in your head, you're strong enough to give yourself that sense of support and belief, that you lacked as a child. "How could they do this to me?" Well...they did. Stop suffering. Get a hold of your adult self. Then go give that scared kid what he/she needed. Strength and stability. Go believe in yourself. So the kid has someone to believe in. I love you, All. Good luck. And, I wish nothing but peace and all the blessings to be had.
Hey guys, last night I saw some videos of a dude spreading the word on instagram that corona is not dangerous and a lot of comparable stupid shit. This made me really angry, that I wanted to throw my phone against the wall. Do you have similar problems with the stupidity of other people? I mean, obviously there are a lot of idiots around, but these manipulative dudes with thousands of followers are taking advantage of them and this makes me even more furious. Do you try to avoid looking at something like this, or is there any good way of accepting?
My husband and I have been married for a year and a half and have a two month old son. My husband and this guy have been friends for years and are pretty close. He moved an hour away a few months ago and doesn't come around as much anymore. My husband and I have a great relationship and we love each other very much. The only area we struggle in is sex. I have a much higher sex drive than him and need more sex than he does. I think it might be making my eyes wander a little, you know? I love my husband and I find him very attractive but he just doesn't want sex as much as I do. His friend is really cool and we've always gotten along well. I never saw him this way until recently and I think it's honestly getting out of hand. I've started thinking about how my life would be if I was with him instead and how our sex would be. It's been a few months of these feelings and even though we don't hang out much they get stronger. I try really hard not to think about him but my feelings won't go away! Is this just me being sad because my life has changed so much with a new baby? Should I tell my husband? **td;lr: growing feelings for husband's good friend. How do I get rid of them?**
A couple of years ago, I used to date a girl. Lets just call her Marzia. See me and Marzia dated for like 2 monthes but I fell in love very quickly. She did too, we would talk everyday, and at home talk on skype. We had our ups and downs but one day some shit got me pretty depressed and mad. He did some shit with her and I had so many thoughts running through my head. We then broke up and got together again, then broke up with her again. I just stopped dating her then because one day when we got into a fight RIGHT IN FUCKING FRONT OF ME SHE SAID TO MY FRIEND "Help me ask out this one guy". I threatened that I would kill myself, she then said "Do it". That drove deeper into the Depression maze. I remember she said she was gonna drink a whole bottle of mouth wash, so I brought that up. I screamed "Why don't you go drink some fucking mouth wash YOU DUMB SLUT". Now It's been 2 years without her and I miss her so much, that was the first girlfriend I've ever had.
A few months ago, my crush told me that she would never date me. It hurt, but I tried not to let that get in the way of us remaining as friends. However, she kept throwing signals at me and basically acting like we're in a committed relationship even though we were just friends. Today, she straight up asked me "Do you have a girlfriend?". I said no. She said "Do you want one?" I said "Kinda, yeah." The conversation ended there. A few hours later, after finally growing a pair, I asked her "Why did you ask me if I had a girlfriend earlier even though you already said you'd never date me?" and she said "Just curious." That's the story of why I loudly and angrily sung along to Weezer's Pinkerton all evening. It made me incredibly angry that she would consistently lead me on like this. Yes, I know that she said she would never date me, but I held onto hope (especially with her sending me these mixed signals all the time). Yes, it could be considered my mistake because I expected our relationship to go further. But I'm just so incredibly angry at her, at myself, and at the world. Now that it's late and there's no one around to talk to, it's beginning to hit me how I actually feel. I'm about to break down and cry. I can't comprehend why someone would do this to me, or hell, to anyone at all. I've been played like a damn fiddle and I'm dying inside. Sorry for rambling, I just needed to get all of this off my chest. I know this is kind of a pointless issue and I'm sorry if this doesn't belong on this sub. To anyone who even made it this far, thank you.
I know that sounds dumb but hear me out. So i'm homeschooled. Have been my whole life. Except after turning... 7 or so (i'm 13) i didn't do work until recently. I have the potential to go into public school next semester (really hoping i stay homeschooled). I'm going through schoolwork books to catch up before then. I've been doing this since January, slacked because we were moving, and now i'm trying to get through the 3 books i have before the month ends. I'm only on the second book (2ND grade schoolwork) and i got so overwhelmed i had a panic attack (this was just about 15 minutes ago). So i stopped. But i feel like i'm doing the wrong thing. Considering it seems like student mental illness is considered "stress" and "laziness" i feel like prioritizing my mental health is selfish and making a big deal out of nothing... it's weird because if someone else told me they were having this problem i'd tell them it's okay to prioritize their problems but with me i feel like if i put my health first i'm lazy and a failure. I don't know what to do.
I was a TA for a chemistry lab over the summer and had a lot of fun. One of my students was a really attractive girl who seems to have her shit together. Obviously at the time I supressed my feelings of attraction towards her since she was a student and I controlled her grade, but I recently saw her on campus and talled with her for a while and I realized I haven't had a good conversation like that in a long time and added her on Facebook. I found out that she had already graduated from a much more prestigious college and is actually older than me. I'm not entirely sure why she was taking the class. Anyway, it's highly unlikely I'll keep in touch if I don't contact her, and I don't really know her super well but I just can't stop thinking about her. I know it's kind of messed up due to the TA situation and super awkward to ask a girl or on Facebook but I am likely never going to see this girl again and I didn't think to say anything when I ran into her on campus. --- **tl;dr**: girl in a lab I was a TA for is really attractive and I want to ask her out but never got her number. On a scale of 1-10, how bad of an idea is it for me to ask her out through Facebook?
this week i have been experiencing what i can only imagine might be some sort of healing, or at least reintegration of a former self that died when my mom died. when she died i couldn't tolerate sensation. it's hard to explain. i could only listen to old music i didn't really care about. i could only watch movies i had low investment in, or had already seen. in the last six years since she died, i have rewatched both gilmore girls and friends at least 3-4 times each, because i know exactly what is going to happen and it doesn't cause too much emotional disturbance. when i moved out of the place i lived at when it happened, i tossed all of my music, and my record player and speakers. i had been in bands for over 10 years, music was one of the things that made the world feel welcoming. i loved challenging music, but i couldn't listen to it anymore. it was just noise. but before her death i would have described myself as sensory seeking with music specifically. this week something has lit up in me. i went to my first show since the pandemic started. i've been saving albums on spotify instead of listening to one song and discarding them. the curiosity that used to be there is coming back around. i just genuinely didn't think this part of me would ever return and i'm feeling so grateful.
for 4 years now ive lived here and i HATE it. ive talked to my parents countless times to move or change our way of living but they wont even bother to give me a straight answer they will just say "maybe one day" or even just "eh". you may be thinking 'oh it cant be that bad i mean it must be separated and im sure its totally fine' NOPE right now we have a bug infestation and i wake up every morning feeling itchy.. i think we have bed bugs but my father isn't bothering with anything and i first thought hey we must be too poor to buy a house but my parents have bought a load of things they could have saved up for a house we have around 4 surfboards for my dad that he hardly uses, 3 ipads, 3 computers a crap load of food we don't need he even have a guitar.. &gt;:C and when you go into the bathroom the shower is covered in mold. and the unit we live in isnt any better because most of the people here are old and sell drugs.. ect and theres graffiti all over the parking lot. i dont even have privacy AT ALL theres no wall or anything and i sleep on a couch while every morning i wake up and my back hurts like hell. they dont even clean the toilet properly. (btw im only 13)
I have severe anxiety/OCD. I'm sick and tired of being a burden to my family and I want to start bringing in income. I'm looking for an online program/degree in a field where I can get a job that I can do. I have severe contamination fears (germaphobia) so I would need a job from home. And my anxiety prevents me from talking on the phone, so it can't be a job involving phone calls. I know this is a reach and i'm sure there are posts about this but anyone with any advice/guidance to point me in the right direction, please help.
I've been with my partner for 3 years and it is mainly good but we keep running into this problem of him not considering me. Like I'll voice how I feel and he will just stonewall me with utter silence and rarely if ever asks me anything about myself ever. Sometimes when we're talking he listens to what I say and then switches to a completely different topic of something he cares about. We also run into the problem of when I share something personal with him or news about myself he only ever talks about how it affects him and how he feels. I'm getting pretty tired of feeling like I don't matter as a person no matter how many times I've mentioned it. Tl;dr My partner just flat out ignores what I say and most conversations are very one sided
Good day to anyone who sees this. I have a lot of built up anger and hate issues. Right now, they are made worse because I have to interact with the person that triggers them every single day. That being said, I also have no way of releasing these emotions moreso dealing with them so they kinda just built up inside me. I am writing this after the worst fit I've had (silently, of course). I was writing what I'm feeling to at least kind of work them out when I just thought that I couldn't take it anymore so I rolled my hand into a fist so hard until I felt my whole body just shaking with anger. After that I noticed my body contract and have this overwhelmingly numb feeling that started with my stomach until it reached my toes and head. I couldn't control my hands and my feet, I felt them hardening. I could also feel my eyelids shaking. It took a few minutes to regain control and turn back into normal but what the fuck just happened? Did I just give myself a stroke because I was so angry?
I don’t understand why you feel the need to kill my cats. One just need medicine, and the other one won’t be in heat forever. You know damn good and well that ive had these cats for as long as I can remember and that they are a part of the family. I’m sick and tired of your psychotic ass telling me you’re gonna kill my cats because you’re tired of them. When you brought them into this house, you assumed part of the fucking responsibility. I do my part, you need to fucking do yours. Piece of shit. ETA- oh cool now my life is being threatened
met this guy at my job, he gave me his number. I’m very very attracted to him. I got pretty attached because we literally talked everyday for 2 months but he would always avoid that “what are we” conversation. he would flirt constantly but in the end he said “i like what we are now.. friends”. that hurt me alot because he led me on for 2 months and i felt like I wasted my time and HE KNEW i liked him. so i pretty much cut him off, and that ended in october. fast forward to new years, he texted me exactly at 12:00am to say happy new years and how have you been. i don’t know what he wants, but my question is should I give him another chance? i still like him even though he lead me on, and i thought about him very often when we ended things. my heart is saying yes but my mind is saying no. help me out reddit! **tl;dr**: should i give a guy who led me on a few months ago another chance? he might have changed.
Lately I have just been wondering around thinking about my life. Right now is one of those times. I have a tendency just to go on long walks at night around my college's campus, and after a while, I usually feel better. However tonight is not really one of those nights, where I get peace out of walking around. Instead I feel lonely. Lonely, walking by myself in the middle of the night. Lonely, passing by where I had so many great times with a friend... That has now forgotten me. Everytime I pass a location on campus where he and I had a good time freshmen year... it hurts just a little bit more. Just not having anyone to talk to about... well... anything... hurts.
Here's some background info on me: I'm 14, high functioning autistic (like a normal person but with a lot of social anxiety and stress) and I just feel really angry every day. I go to school, don't want to talk to anyone, sometimes piss off my friends because of my anger. I go home, any small thing that pisses me off makes me furious, I shout at my mother (I know, it's not good, I need help) and go to my room for the rest of the day. I play video games as an escape and it really helps but sometimes I rage so much and it makes me even more angry. Some days I feel really depressed and can hardly even say anything without it sounding malicious or rude. I wouldn't say I am depressed because I do feel better in the end but I still feel something. If you have any advice to me on how to redirect that anger to something else or how to not feel so shit all day, please share. Thank you, Jake P
You know the worst part for me, about my husband dying?? Not having a single soul to celebrate the good days with! It pisses me off that Every "friend" I have is Never available to call and just talk, especially about the tiny victories and good stuff that happens. This flat pisses me off and hurts so bad. I HATE TEXTING!! HATE HATE HATE TEXTING! I miss phone calls! They're much more personal! Why can't people call anymore. I'm 58! In my day people reached out and called or ,God forbid, wrote a hand written letter or dropped a card to see if you were OK or just to catch up. I remember waiting anxiously for the next letter to come in the mail from your friend or relative. Now, I'll be damned if any one even dares to use their real voice, or try to write anything. Oh but they can text! You Don't even know if it's actually the person they say they are! I'm SICK , like putridlly sick of this Fake world with its pretend people who are too damn scared or lazy to put their real faces out there. Y'all... I'm sick of the un-needed isolation. It's repugnant. I need real humans to talk to. Not machines, or avatars. Is there anything real any more?? To those who are real and trying to be "really human " I'm sorry...I meant no offense. Just fed up and pissed. But not at Y'all. Drea.
In my whole life, I've been through a lot of separation, I moved 7 times, say goodbye more than a thousand time, my parents broke up, I lived with my mom and she married my step dad, who treated me badly, my friends hated me because I'm gay, my mom hated gay, Christian also hated me, my crush didn't accept me and he blocked me. I thought that I'm in a horrible situation and with that in mind, I joined r/sad, but for some reason I just can't feel sad. Today was the last day in "Coach For College", everyone was so sad, they all cried, even boys, but I just can't feel sad. I said that I'm sad but... I don't know. Everything that has happened to me was so bad, but... I can't just... Well maybe I'm strong and I'm used to all of this, that's what I thought. But when I look back, I can't remember the last time that I cried, even my mom said that when I was a kid, I didn't cry much. I think I'm Soulless. The worst thing is that if I'm don't have a soul, everything bad that will happen to me, I won't tell anyone about it, because I'm not upset about it. And then one day, when everything get worse, I'm going to suicide before I tell anyone. That's not the only reason I think I'm soulless, I can't get mad at all, that's a good thing I know but that's also another good reason to say that I'm soulless. I don't want to be like this anymore. Even if the worst thing happen to me, all I want is to just... cry.
A few days ago my health care agent and I spoke. I told her that I was not willing to go to an appointment where they looked at my girly bits. I explained why, and she pretended like she understood. She convinced me to go, under the guise that I wouldn’t have to even change into a gown, and that she had talked directly to my doctor. I was LIED to MAJORLY. I was forced to change into a gown with no ties. The doctor tried to make me get completely naked, and she straight up said that my health care agent never even called the office. She suddenly wasn’t very kind anymore, and I had to say no seven times to get her to not do the exam before she asked why. Apparently she didn’t read my chart, or the two major bits of my information are no longer there. Needless to say, I think I need a new agent and possibly a new doctor if she can’t take the word no.
I've posted the full thing in the depression subreddit but since talking about anxiety is harder I thought I'd post it here, too! I want to talk to my doctor about my depression/anxiety because it's been going on for months/years and has gotten much worse. The problem is I don't actually know how exactly I should talk about it. I'm really bad at putting my emotions into words but concerning anxiety it's even harder! Everytime I try to explain my anxiety to people I just get shushed since "Everyone experiences anxiety sometimes" or "Just stop worrying so much!" So: what exactly should I mention to my doctor? What is important to say so I don't get the "Anxiety is normal" stuff once again? Thank you! Edit: Thank you all for your lovely answers!! It's definitely been a great help and I will try to write all of it down when I go to my doctor tomorrow (hopefully)!
Before I start this post some more details. We are in an almost two year old relationship, and things have been going pretty amazingly until maybe a couple of months ago. After a long, hard think, I think it's mostly due to this relationship transforming into something more serious. We are colleagues at college, and I'd say we make a pretty good team overall, both at work and outside of it. She is an amazing girl, and I most certainly do not want to fuck this up. What's been bothering me so much is that I feel that I'm not mature enough to handle how serious this relationship is. I quit pornography over a year ago because I felt like it was hurting our relationship, and then things improved quite dramatically. After that for a whole year it was the most exciting time of my life. Now I fear that the honeymoon phase is ending and I don't know how to handle this. I'm not saying this evolution is bad, to be honest I welcome it! But things have been feeling less intense, which puts the paranoid in me in overdrive, and starts questioning whether I'm losing feelings for this girl. The rational part in me knows I'm still fully in love, and I'm committed to making this work for a lot longer than two years. I just think that I'm not mature enough to handle this, I'm feeling kinda lost, and I was hoping for a little guidance in how to take this relationship to an adult level. --- **tl;dr**: Feel like honeymoon phase is ending, don't know how to handle it maturely, how do I handle this?
I know my anger is something I must deal with. But what do you do when your family keeps pushing your buttons!! I tell them to stop because I can feel myself getting ready to blow. I try to stay calm but they go on and on and on. I eventual loose my shit and then they look at me like I am the ass hole. Example: today I am just tired. We have been on vacation for a week. I am just tired. They keep asking me over and over what's wrong. I tell them I am tired, that's not good enough for them. So they keep asking over and over. I tell them to please stop asking, they say I am being a jerk. I can feel myself starting to get angry. What do you do when your family won't stop and pushes you to the brink
So i went through a breakup recently and it left me fucked up. I was emotionally abused to stay in the relationship it kinda fucked me up when i think about it. My situation at home isnt great either my mom and dad are fighting a lot and sometimes take out their frustrations on me. I dont have many friends except for gurls who friendzoned me or 1 or 2 guys that talk behind my back My grades have been going down for a few weeks now. I need to turn it around so i can make people proud and hopefully be a bit happier in the future
Basically, he used to stay up until 3am either gaming with his friends or looking at his phone until my dad started turning off the WiFi at 11. Now I basically have to go to bed at the same time as him or just stay up reading. I can't believe I agreed to put up with another whole year of this shit. My other option would be living on campus where I wouldn't have to deal with him or my parents but considering that my uni and the rest of my country is in the grip of beervirus hysteria it's probably better to just live at home where I don't have to check my temperature every day and wear a mask every time I leave my room. Fuck it I'm done with this shit. It was hard enough just to get out of bed and now all I've got to look forward to for the foreseeable future is this crap.
I don’t get angry often. But the times that I do, I act on that feeling. I’ve broken things, hurt myself, tried to hurt other people (not physically, but emotionally). Lately I’ve found myself slipping into continuous thoughts of anger, like I’m easily triggered or something. I have angry thoughts about doing things to the people who have hurt/done wrong to me. I suppose many people have thought like this, but given my history in handling my anger, I’m nervous I might act out on it again. These thought won’t stop though. I think about how hurt I feel, and then I get angry and want to seek out some retribution. Again, I haven’t done anything yet, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t itching to do so.
I used to have terrible anxiety and depression. I’m talking worrying nonstop about the smallest things and it tends to be things I cannot control. I’ve learned to handle my thoughts for a while, but I do get into moods where I almost feel uneasy when I’m not worrying- about anything. Whether it’s about my health, my family members, what I’m gonna do the next day, my past failures, If my nephews are okay, etc. Right now, I don’t even wanna go to bed alone because my mind will start racing about the smallest things. Someone please give me methods to stop. Thank you so much.
My wife [50 F] left me [50 M] last October after 20 years of marriage and it broke me, my life was over. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't do my job, lost 10kg in weight, was on anti depressants and sleeping pills. I was a wreck. Then, six months ago I went for a drink with a female colleague mainly because I was lonely and just wanted the company and it turns out we have a lot in common and get along really well and we have been dating ever since. She is so good for me, makes me laugh is relaxed, and understands I have history. She is also 18 years younger than me and has never been married. Basically then, life is getting back on track and an awful lot better than I ever imagined it would ever be again. Why then, do I still spend so much time thinking about my wife? I go to sleep with her in my thoughts and wake up thinking about her. I constantly think of times were together and things we did. I would go back to her in a heartbeat. So, why do I still love my wife so much when this lady I'm with now loves me and supports me so much and has done so much to help me get my life back on track. Please help me understand my thoughts. tl;dr: Why do I still miss my wife so much?
For almost a year now, I’ve had a class with this girl, and we seem to get along great- I feel like we genuinely enjoy each other’s company. I feel like there’s something there, but we don’t really talk outside of class, and we don’t have an ongoing text conversation. I kind of suck at this part- I live in a city where it’s pretty hard to meet people, so I’m not sure if I’m misinterpreting things or if she might potentially be interested. I haven’t asked her out till now for a lot of reasons- I’ve been dealing with some weight issues (but I’ve gotten way more fit and lost 15 pounds recently!). We’re both super busy people who are both prepping to apply to grad schools, so we haven’t had too much free time. Do you think it would be reasonable to take a shot and ask her if she’d like to grab a drink or coffee sometime? If so, would it be better to ask in person or send a text? Would it be weird to send a text asking for a date out of the blue? **TL;DR: I’m interested in this girl from class; we’re both super busy, so we haven’t spent much time together outside of class; not sure if I should ask her out.**
So I don't have anger issues in the traditional sense, I repress my anger to an unhealthy level. So the other day this girl we'll call J decided to ask me out on a date, first time that I've ever gone on a date so naturally I felt happy as anything. a few days after the date she messages me saying she wants something casual and not a relationship and that "she never wanted anything like that and doesn't want anymore more than that". So naturally I feel pretty shitty but I go along with it to see if it develops into something more. Cut to this morning, the bus station changed the bus schedule so I had to get a train, walk through 30 minutes worth of rain with a shit tier umbrella, buy an energy drink after already having a coffee less than an hour ago because I felt so fucking angry, and the entire time I'm walking through the rain I slowly get angrier and angrier. I waited until this group of kids near me cut away to go to school and I went on a rant to myself to try to vent about problems I didn't even realise I had, stuff about my dad, my work, the fact I can't handle emotions; the works basically. tl;dr: girl asks me out, wants something casual, I repress every emotion I have to an unhealthy level, it all came out this morning, my suit's wet from the rain, and if I don't find a way to vent it out I WILL most likely throw a glass at someone if they piss me off.
I don't know where else to reach out to but I hope someone can point me in the right direction. Sorry if my terminology is correct as I'm not familiar with this. My wife and I found out today that we are losing the baby. The emotions are overwhelming right now. Can someone explain to me what some of the options are for when she passes the baby? Is it realistic to have something like a cremation of burial? I'm going to have this conversation with her but I'd like to be more informed going into it and right now all our time is spent sobbing and holding each other. Just saying the words out loud right now is overwhelming. To give some background information, she should be 10 weeks pregnant now but two weeks ago at our 8 week appointment the baby was measuring around 6 weeks. After developing miscarriage symptoms over the weekend (light spotting and cramping), she went in today and the doctor confirm that there is no longer a heartbeat or blood flow. They offered her a medicine to speed up the process of the baby leaving her body but she's declined it for now. I guess if it's not happening within two weeks then they recommend her taking it anyways. We are both grieving immensely but I want to be able to support her the best I can emotionally and physically. Can anyone direct me to somewhere that I can get information on what her body will be experiencing when this happens? Thanks, my hurting wife and I appreciate it.
It's happened 4 times in the last 10 months since she died. I'll go out with friends, have my usual 2 drinks over a few hours, have a lovely time. And then when I would usually switch to water, I get another drink. And then another. Last night I had 5 drinks in 5 hours. I just know that when I stop drinking, the buzzy feeling will start to fade. And I'll be slammed in the face with the full weight of my grief. I don't regret my behavior the next morning, or black out or do anything embarrassing. I just feel ashamed that I use alcohol to cope sometimes. Most of my best friends are sober, and I try to be really conscious of my relationship with alcohol -- like I never drink if I "need a drink," just in social settings or a hot toddy when it's cold. But I hate the idea of using it to cope. But sometimes I slide down that slippery slope and it makes me sad. That's all. I wish I had my mom back.
my mom is sick. she destroyed her liver drinking for decades(i was taken away because of it 7 years after my father died when i was 5, im 24 now) she is in and out of the hospital because her stomach is filling with the things her liver can’t process (i.e. everything) and has to get it drained basically every two weeks. she lives across the country and i had only seen her for the first time since i was 11 just this past december. she was so sick looking i couldn’t bare it. all i wanted was to take care of her, help her. she’s stubborn and weird and says odd things but i love her so much. i feel like a child again losing my parent. i feel so alone and scared. i try to talk to her everyday. she’s in a lot of pain and i just want her to be okay. im really scared there’s not much time left and i haven’t even processed the fact that my dad has been dead for almost 20 years. i feel like i’m going to lose my mind. im really terrified. i just want a hug and to have my mom and dad back, i still feel like the little girl who lost her dad and saw that take the life out of my mom simultaneously. im not sure where to go from here i think i need really intense therapy my seams are coming loose as each day passes
I really am a nice person but when somebody pisses me off I cannot control my hatred. I get so angry that I become nauseous and I wish bad things upon people. This has been going on my whole life, I suppose it originated in my childhood. The first time I can remember this rage is when I was 11 and a boy I liked rejected me. I sat in my room and made a voodoo doll of him, I would fantasize about stabbing him and leave notes in his locker telling him to die. I've vandalized people's houses. The other night a girl grabbed my boyfriends ass and I flew into a rage. I wanted her to kill herself. These thoughts are so intense that they physically hurt my chest and I am still trying to calm myself down, days later. I've had therapists and psychiatrists my whole life and none of them have helped. I am currently on meds which do help calm me down on a daily basis but my current psychiatrist only wants to throw more pills at me. I'm tired of pills, I've taken so many. Please you guys, do you have advice on how I can learn to control this rage/tips for not obsessing? I would seriously never hurt anyone physically and I feel it's important to point out that these are just intense fantasies that play over and over in my head. I am trying to be a better person and my inability to help myself makes me hate myself.
Two weeks ago or so, I [24M] discover that this girl, [24F] who I really liked when I was in university four years ago, was into me as well at the same time. We started wondering what would happen if I we had dated back then. We've seen each other just a couple of times but we have just chat through WhatsApp. Now, I am living in Sydney and she's still in Uni in Colombia. After we found out we liked each other we have been texting and talking each other very intensely. At some point I was thinking in moving back to Colombia to date her and see what happens since we have great chemistry and still like each other. Somehow, we are planning to have our first date in December this year in neutral territory (Germany). We haven't doubt a second about it but I'm curious. Do you guys think that this is moving too fast? I can tell that she is authentic and sincere about her feelings and so am I. **TL;DR**: We found out we like each other and after texting during two weeks we are planning our first date overseas in December. I'm in Australia. She's in Colombia.
I’ll keep this short, I’ve been dating a wonderful, selfless girl for 8 months. Everything has been perfect up until recently. She’s been very depressed because she feels guilty about quitting her job and going to a new company (this comes for her loyalty quality). She hasn’t been sexual for about 6 weeks now and it’s been getting more and more difficult. I feel unwanted, guilty for wanting to have sex, and I have to avoid situations that would arouse me because I don’t want to feel ashamed for not being into it. She’s offered to be intimate with me but I can’t get into sex if it’s simply to satisfy my physical desires (ex: I never asked for oral sex from a previous partner because I knew she didn’t enjoy that even though I do). I’m not sure how to approach this or if it’s wrong for me to be struggling with this situation. When we talk about it, it makes her sad. How should I handle this? tl;dr My depressed GF offer to have sex with me but I can’t take her up because I know she’s not completely into it.
So a few weeks ago, I had a friend introduce me to a girl. We hit it off pretty well, texting on and off for the past few weeks, and we bought concert tickets for Valentine's Day to go together. The other night we had a little party and me and my best friends place with her and a few other friends. At about 2, I noticed my buddy (who knew I was trying to have a thing with the girl) start trying to get close with her. I don't think anything of it and go to bed at 3. The next day, I find out from the friend trying to set me up the girl that my best friend had made out with her after I went to bed. He was extremely drunk, but claims he is still aware of everything that happens when he's drunk. He is always really pushy with girls, and he had tried to get her to spend the night. From the sound of it, he was pretty much on her and she didn't really want to do it. I gave him a full day to tell me and he decided to just keep me in the dark. He just left this morning for a trip to Cali and I won't see him for 3 days. I'm still going to have to live with the guy and I still have this possible date with the girl on Valentine's Day, but I don't know how to feel about her now. How should I confront my roommate? Should I confront the girl at all? TL;DR: best friend took the girl I've been flirting with a few days before I have a "date" with her on Valentine's Day, knowing that I had a thing with her.
So. Simplest way to put this. My ex, the one I talked about before, sent me a picture of her and the guy she dated before me (for a year, and whom she got a STD from) and I am absolutely. . Furious. I cant function. Ive shut everyone out and have been spending the last few hours trying not to reply. Id be in /r/relationships if I thought I still gave an ounce of a shit about her and I's past relationship or the chance of getting together. I just want to know how to stop caring what she does. Who shes with. Because otherwise im going to bash someone's skull in
After a recent split with my wife I had a rough few months. I honestly was not looking for a relationship but I started talking to a coworker as friends and eventually we started talking more and more at work, then it graduated to messenger outside of work, then texting and now a relationship. We have been dating for a month now and started talking two and a half months ago. So it is definitely not something rushed. It was a natural evolution, at least in my opinion it was. However, my question is how can I be sure this is not simply a rebound relationship. It may seem like a dumb question but I am very interested in this girl and this relationship. She has made me realize everything wrong in my previous relationship and I am actually happy again. Dating her would be considered outside the norm of what either of us would normally look for in the opposite sex, so possibly this is a good thing since both of our previous relationships failed. Not sure if anyone can answer this question other than myself and taking a deep look into it and myself, but just wanted to check with people who probably have more life experience than I do. TLDR: Entering a recent relationship shortly after divorce, want to ensure it works.
Been feeling horribly down recently. I feel like a massive burden to my friends. I fake being happy around my family. I’m starting to feel drained. I just want to be happy. I feel like I’ve been truly happy one time in my life, and I don’t know if I’ll ever get that back. Nothing seems to go my way, and when it does, I find a way to mess it up. I feel like giving up. Constantly. I want to be 10 again. I want to stop feeling like I’m not needed. I want to stop feeling like a disappointment. I’ve been depressed since middle school. And I’ve had chances to get out of it. I didn’t take them. I let them slip out of my fingers because I’m a fucking idiot. And I hate myself for it. I absolutely resent myself for not taking the chances I was given. I wish I could go back in time knowing what I know now. I wish I could have another chance. I just want to be normal. I want to feel happy. I want to look forward to something without it blowing up in my face. I don’t even know why I’m posting this. I guess because I don’t want to bother my friends anymore, and it feels better to know that someone might hear this. I just feel desperate, I guess. I hope everyone out there is doing better than I am. Sending hugs to anyone who needs them.
I know lots of you people benefit from at least some sort of help from the sleeping with heavier blankets. My post here is looking to understand a bit more of what could be done better - is there anything you would want more of a weighted blanket? - is there a different size/weight that might appeal to you vs. what the industry offers? - did anyone try the All Season weighted blankets (one side warm minky and one side organic cool bamboo - "the velvet feeling") ? any thoughts? - what about the weighted blankets for kids? what is your experience with those? Feel free to express any other thoughts on the topic in general. I'm pretty sure all our team is watching this thread and taking notes :) Thank you for taking a bit of time to help!
I’m just so goddamn angry at the world and everyone around me. I can’t stand up for my beliefs because I will lose everything. Obviously my only option is to change or die. I’ve overdosed before. Sometimes I get sad because I survived the overdose. Lately I’ve been thinking about killing myself. People just make me angry. I think one thing that helps me to think better about my situation is asking myself where I want to go in life. Because there’s heaven, there’s hell. And if I had a job I could possibly make friends. I’m also angry at my thoughts. It’s hard to control my thoughts because of my situation that I can’t really change. I really want this to get better..
Hello all of r/Anger I hope you are sitting while reading this (if you don’t want read this that’s fine) Here’s my little story I am a 30 year old small business owner. I own a store with my family and my wife. My wife is everything I’ve ever needed in my life. Recently we have gotten into some arguments (nothing physical) but it always leads me to anger like I’ve never had before. I spend some nights crying to myself asking for help then eventually sleep and wake up and pretend like everything is fine and back to normal. Usually our arguments are about me not being more aware of a small little situation and not doing what I should be told or just screwing up something due to my neglect or carelessness. I continue to tell my wife I’m trying to get the help I need. I am not a big drinker or drug user and would never resort to that sort of stuff. I do know that I need help. With these strange times happening here in the USA I’m looking for some sort of help if any, that any of you people can provide to me to try and fix things for me. I’m an open book to any sort of questions Thank you all so much I hope you enjoy your day
I've been hanging out with this girl regularly for over a year (we're both 21 and in college), when we are together she would tell me that she really likes hanging out with me and have more fun than she could ever have with anybody else on any day. For a few months, when we go out drinking, she would always end up kissing me and wanting more, it was starting to get really out of hand so we stopped after awhile. But I still absolutely love spending time her, she makes my world most beautiful when I'm with her. We have the same interests, same kind of humor, we make everything we do fun and interesting. There is never a dull moment with her. The problem is that she has a boyfriend, but she doesn't want to leave him because he's financially secured and she's the kind of person who is super scared of changes so she's really doesn't plan to leave him anytime soon. Because of that, I know that she wouldn't be good for me. I still try to hang out with her, hoping that she might eventually changes her mind one day. But I feel like all I'm doing to myself is letting this anger and frustration build up inside, I'm pushing people away and I can't seem to stop it. I wish I wasn't so stubborn. I just don't wanna give up on someone who truly makes me happy I just really needed to rant and let this out... Thanks for reading
I've had anxiety problems since my early teens but, aside from somewhat regular panic attacks, only a few times has it had a big effect on day to day life. Now is one of those times. I've got a pain in my head. It's a blunt pain on the top of my head and it feels almost as if a giant thumb is pressing down on me. It's not really painful, it's just a tightness. I can't go see my GP because it's New Years and my doctors is closed, and to some degree I think it might be psychological. It gets worse when I think about it (nearly all the time) and last night I made it worse by convincing myself I had either Gorsham's disease or a brain tumour. I don't need a diagnosis I just want to ask people whether they've experienced this type of thing.
i hope it's okay to post this here, i lost my father close to a year ago and i want to know how I can support my mom. how do you think your kids can help you deal with things? what little things do they do that make it easier for you? what do you wish they would do more or less often? especially for older kids, college aged and up. i feel like my grief process and mindset is so incredibly different. i try to help however i can, but i always somehow say or do the wrong thing. i really want to do better. another thing I've been struggling with is moving out of home. yes, there will be people and I'm not leaving her alone. but it still feels like I'm abandoning and the guilt is huge...
Today was a shit day. I have a girlfriend and we have been together for 3 years (i'm just 15 years old) but when i came to school today, i saw something that made my heart break into shattered glass. I saw my girlfriend KISSING another dude in my class. And i just pretended it was a normal day because i was gonna confront her after school. But after school she said to me that she was going over to a friend and just left into a random car. But thing is the same dude she was kissing was in the same fucking car that she went into. Now i didn't know what to do, so i went home... Crying for 2 hours straight, and then my mom shouted my name to tell me something and i get fucking news from my mom that my grandmother just recently passed away. Now i wanted to cry even more, so i cry for 1 hour longer. And then my rude, annoying and perverted step father comes in my room just to tell me to stfu, because i cried so loudly. And then he told me to do the dishes and then wash the clothes. I was like wtf you idiot, don't you know what i have been through!!? So i went to a friend cause i don't like my family and my life, and that friend has a sharp knife, so i was gonna do it. You know what i mean right? But my friend convinced me not to do it, so i didn't. And know i dont know what to do. Please help me god. Please end me.
My Mama passed away 2 weeks ago. The heartache is unbearable. She was 67. I was with her until the very end. She was the best Mama a girl could ask for. She taught me so much. I can only pray that I can be half the woman she was. Will the tears ever stop? Does the heartache get any better? I lost my Daddy very suddenly 8 years ago. That hurt, but this is a different kind of pain. I think I’m going to die of a broken heart. I just had to put this out here. I try to be the strong one at work and I have to keep my family going. My husband still has both his parents and he just doesn’t understand. I feel like I’m alone in this world without her. I’m sorry if I ramble. My heart is broken and I don’t think I will ever get over it.
I had a bad grief wave today , very strong that I felt I couldn’t breath. I didn’t want to live any more. These waves are getting stronger as each day is passing. People tell me it gets easier but I’m struggling to believe this , it’s been five weeks since I last hugged my child, five weeks since I last heard his voice. I’m supposed to be going back to work next week but I can’t manage a day without crying. I’m feel like I’m sinking deeper and deeper into grief and does this mean what acceptance feels like ? I still don’t believe he is gone so I don’t think it’s that.
For some backstory, my brother died very suddenly by suicide. It was very unexpected, as he was the most lively person in our family. Me and him have always been very close and would talk at least once a week. The first dream I had of him was a little odd, but he came walking up to me (he passed my mom and dad without saying anything) and we just walked and talked. I remember thinking “people are going to think I’m crazy because they probably can’t see him”. The other dream I had last night. We were all getting together on the anniversary of when he had passed. My whole family was sitting in the living room talking about memories and questions they still had. My brother was sitting amongst us and started to get upset. He said a few things but no one acknowledged him. I went and sat with him and he said, “it was impulsive. I didn’t know there were any rounds in my gun. I didn’t feel anything, and I don’t remember dying. I let my younger self down and I let y’all down I’m sorry.” We sat and cried a little together and then said he said, “I see how hard this is on y’all and I’m so sorry. I feel guilty.” We then changed the subject and started to talk about alcohol drinks. Could this actually be him visiting me?
I get it... All five of them moved to west coast last spring and they’re having the time of their lives reinventing themselves and having lots of great sex with each other/new people or whatever... Happy for them. But I was really sad to see them go and I’ve been severely depressed and suicidal feeling like my life has emptied since they left. I’ve realized those years with them were the best of my life. Not great at making new friends. Not getting a single happy birthday text from them today when they remembered my partner’s birthday two months ago feels like I really am not worth remembering :(
I met a girl at art college 9 years ago. After being friends for 2 years, I realised I loved her. I didn't just like her; I wanted to be with her more than anything else. For one reason or another, I didn't say anything. It never felt like the right time. But I waited for years. I held it in for so long because I felt I had to make this happen. I realise now that probably wasn't the right thing to do. Anyway, she's now had a child and is marrying the dad. I told her how I felt, but of course it was too late. 8 months after the kid was born, and I'm still hurting. Is it always going to be like this? How do I cope?
My time has been measured, there is so little left. My death will come as no surprise to some. To others, who could not have known how evil I was, they will be sad, they may miss me. But who I am has no place anymore. In this world, in this life. So I am obligated to go through with this ending. Sooner may be rather than later. My life has never had meaning. My life gave so little joy. Why must I stay, causing more suffering than my end could ever bring? Why can I not find relief in death, instead of being made to suffer as well? It is not pessimists who kill themselves, for if they have no reason to live, what reason have they to die? It is optimists, who have found their optimism misguided, who have lost their meaning, that die willingly. I have failed in my optimism. I have failed all who've known me. My wife no longer wants to share a bed, my kids don't care what I say. I look at my life, and I see how i have lost everything.
That’s how long it’s been since my brother left us. Today is my first day back at work since it happened and I’m struggling. I went to send him a video today and my body shuddered. I sent it anyway, and just for a second thought I’d get a “haha” back. Sometimes I can fully accept what happened and other times I feel like I’m gonna wake up any second. I had just gotten married a month before he left and last week I found out I am pregnant. I don’t know how to reconcile the deep sadness these 2 events are bringing me now. They are supposed to be 2 the happiest in my life. I don’t feel happy, I feel like I can’t handle this right now. All I want is to share this news with him and I can’t. I need him to be here for this. How can I be happy?
This is a serious question. Not joking around or whatever. I literally made a throwaway because this is a really embarrassing problem but I need to ask for help... I’m going on a 4 day trip soon and I’m worried about ... bowel movements. I have pretty bad bathroom anxiety and although I’ll be staying in hotels, I won’t be by myself. And I’m gonna be in the car for many hours on the way there and back home (we’re driving instead of flying since it would be too expensive). I always get constipated on trips, which I know many people deal with. But being bathroom shy on top of that makes it even worse. And even when I’m at home, I tend to get a little backed up but that’s mainly because of low water intake/not the best diet and medications (at least that’s what I think the problem is). I’m seriously considering taking laxatives for a few days prior to leaving, and then barely eating while on the trip. I would honestly rather feel bad because of low blood sugar, than being constipated. At home I use Senokot to help, and I’ll bring that with me on the trip but I feel like it just won’t be enough. I seriously don’t know what I should do and I don’t want this issue to ruin the trip. Anyone have a similar issue and/or can offer advice? I know it’s an uncomfortable question/concern but fuck I’m stressing about it lol. I HATE bathroom anxiety :(
No, not kind of sympathy issue. I have sympathy to the point where it eats me up with sadness and I just want to go into a corner and cry. Today was the last of a camp I was in. I had made friends with one of the kids there. Let’s call him, Dave. We were doing an activity where the advisors picked groups for us (a debate). I had gotten a really good team with Dave and another kid who I also wanted. The issue, was that they wanted to switch the kid who I wanted. So, I asked if I could keep the kid and they said yeah, but then they would move Dave from my group. The thing was, I didn’t try enough to keep Dave, and they ended up moving him. When he was going to the group he had this look on his face which tore me to shreds. It made me want to just go and cry. Fast forward after the activity, we made up and all was good. The thing is that now, I feel so so bad and once again, I feel like bawling my eyes out over this. He was such a nice person and would always say the same thing to me after everyday: Live well, live happy, love well. I just feel like crying. what’s wrong with me?
My family moved to a new town halfway through my Sophomore year and I'm two days into my Junior year at my current school. I've never been good at making friends or socializing so the fact that I even had a friend at my old school surprises me. We were friends since middle school and we were always pretty close. After I moved I kept in touch with him a bit over Facebook but our conversations would never last as long as they did before I moved. During summer break I asked him a couple times if I could come back to town and stay over at his place so we could hang out again but he always said he didn't have time. Since the last time I asked him to hang out we've chatted a couple times but our conversations keep getting shorter and shorter. I feel that he's totally moved on from me and seeing him with new people makes me feel like I'm just clinging on to the past.
And then that makes you feel worse when people don't meet those expectations? Like I have two coworkers who are friends, who always go out to lunch pretty much every day. I try to do that with my friend at work, and it's almost impossible to do this more than once a month. But because there's this expectation in my head that lunches must be every single day at work, and my friend cannot do that, it makes me anxious and makes me think that my friend does not like me. Even though my friend and I regularly text and talk to one another. This isn't the first time I've had such specific expectations and then feel horrible and anxious because they are not met. Can anyone else relate?

So I dmd my ex girlfriend on Instagram asking if we could talk because I wanted to apologize to her. It’s been 2 months since we’ve last talked and I just wanted to tell her I’m sorry for my actions and everything I did wrong I’m the relationship. I had dmd her and she ended up blocking my instagram. What should I do leave her alone, or what? I just want her to know I’m sorry and if she could forgive me. I didn’t do anything bad in the relationship just was a bit immature and annoying. I know I should probably leave her alone but it’s been a burden weighting down on me and I need her to know that I’m sorry. TL;DR My ex girlfriend blocked me on Instagram after I asked if we could talk after it being 2 months of NC. What should I do?
We took in a very young kitten from a farm last monday. He was the last of the litter,rest died of pneumonia and colds, while he had a bad case of pneumonia as well. He fought it hard, was playful,even, and we named him Leo. Leo had to be put down this morning,hours into my last shift of the week, the bacteria was just too far spread, and now Leo is gone. He was a sweetie, he loved to lay underneath your chin, or sit on your shoulder like a parrot. I wish i could have been there for him in the end.. I wish i could have seen the signs he wasnt getting better. At least he isnt suffering any more. But now i am, because i believed he would win.
I have serious anger issues, yet no one knows, because I keep it bottled inside. However, over the past two years, more and more events in my life and in society have fed that anger, and I am slightly scared of what I could do if I can't control it like I normally do. For example, I recently read 3 articles, one about minorities and prison, one about Kim Davis, and one about an Iranian female soccer player...All have different levels of injustice, and after every article I had to go for a walk to cool off. I bit my lip and drew blood as I read the Kim Davis piece. As I grow older, I realize that injustice is the strongest trigger for my anger...and in this day and age of Donald Trump, the aforementioned Kim Davis, police officers killing black people without consequence, and the general malaise that is the internet, I can see A LOT of injustice... I don't want to be the stereotypical angry black man, but society has a habit of making that quite hard not to be. I'm not even considered a stereotypical black man, as I have different likes and views from the "normal" (Read: How society "sees" us) African American. Does anyone have the same feelings that I do, where almost every story or article fills them with a rage that needs to be held in check? I would like to know of some techniques others use.
I'm in college and I'm not too fond of minor holidays like St. Patrick's Day, where it's big enough to be an event but not big enough for me to go home for it or anything. I really don't like going to frat parties, but I feel like I should be going to one to celebrate the holiday? or something? Even though it's really not that important? I used to feel like that on new year's eve before I had good friends to celebrate it with, like everyone else is going out and celebrating today and I'm doing something bad for not doing that too. Anyone else feel like this?
My died dad of covid back in December. Right before he got sick we started looking for our first house. With my siblings, he helped them so much with their houses (going to the inspections, fixing things up, etc). Now that we found a house, I can’t help but think what I would do to have him here with me during this process. Life is so unfair. It just hurts everyday thinking about him not being here with me. I feel like all the typical “milestones” in adulthood are constant reminders that he isn’t here. I’m sorry for anyone else going through grief- thinking of you all.
I go out drinking quite regularly, but always suffer from quite bad hangover anxiety. I spend the whole day with this feeling and continually get 'flashbacks' of the previous night - even to the point of hearing people I was out with talking in my head. It sometimes relates to a specific embarrassing moment, but most of the time it's a general impression that I've made a fool of myself. I often try to distract myself, but it's always there and it stops me from sleeping at night. I was just wondering how you think I should deal with this? I've tried drinking less, but even just a few beers will create this hyperanxiety. I also enjoy going out and alcohol is a great social lubricant - I have good memories of my nights out (eventually), so abstinence isn't really an option. Thanks for any help.
I didn't know where to post this, so hope it is suitable for here.Today is my birthday, and I know I'm not a child, I don't expect fireworks, but I still believe that people ought to feel extra special on this one day of the year.When people around me have a birthday - not just my closest ones, but colleagues, friends, acquaintances etc - I always make sure to congratulate them with a personal message, none of those cliche one-liners most people say by default, either. &#x200B; Today is my birthday and only very few people have remembered to congratulate me and I'm sitting here with a glass of chardonnay, scrolling aimlessly at my Facebook news feed and seeing the activity of so many "friends" who post and like things, yet don't bother to acknowledge me at all. Especially those, who had birthdays recently and I have congratulated them. &#x200B; I know, I know...this all sounds incredibly petty and silly, like a petulant child.But I can't lie, it hurts my feelings enough to put me on the verge of tears - like...do I mean so little to people?Do I not matter enough to get at least basic respect when I have an occasion? I just needed to rant somewhere, thank you for reading!
I plan on proposing to my girlfriend of 3 years in 2 weeks on top of a mountain we will be hiking. I'm super excited but I'm a semi anxious person and I'm nervous and overthinking how I should ask her dad for his daughters hand. Should i just go to his house or ask him to do something? We don't have much in common so I'm not sure how to ask. I'm looking for suggestions on when and where to talk to him. Edit: Adding that my gf and I have had conversations about her wanting me to ask her father. However I misspoke by saying I wanted his permission in the post. I meant I wanted to ask for his blessing not permission! I love her and I'm going to propose but I want her family to know I value and respect them as well. --- **tl;dr**: I'm looking for suggestions on how to ask my gfs dad for permission to propose to her
ok, so i am 14. she is 14 I asked this girl out the other day, and we plan on going to the movies. I have never been on a date before and have no idea what to do. This is technically my first girlfriend. I have talked to a few girls but always come to not knowing how to ask them out. I finally said fuck it and went with it. Now i am in a deep pool of shit because our date is coming up and i have no clue what to do. I have got 30 bucks to spend there. I just need to know like do i pick her up, what do i say, etc. is 30 bucks enough? i figured that is plenty. ive worked for it and sold a little bit of stuff. I really don't want my mom to know but i am sure that is unavoidable. I would ask my dad but i have not seen him in 11 years, so that is out of the question. So how do i tell my mom too? please help reddit!! **TL;DR** i have never been on a date and don't know what to do.
I (27M) feel like I spend a significant portion of my day with lingering anger over past events and towards other people. A lot of it is anger at them, and some of it seems like anger towards myself for not being able to handle these situations in a constructive way in which I don’t allow people to walk all over me but also not exploding in a fit of rage. That seems to be one of the hardest lines to walk. I have been working on trying to let things go and become aware of when I start to feel myself fuming...what happens a lot is that I will blurt our scenarios in my head of things I would have liked to say to people during past events when I am alone. Yeah I know sounds like a crazy person. Has anybody in this thread been able to find peace with their anger? This is something which is very important to me, I one day hope to become totally in control of my emotions and transcend this anger. Has anybody gotten to this place?
I'm sitting here, delaying going to bed for fear of the nightmares. They started last night (I lost my husband six days ago... and tonight is the one-week anniversary of the last really bad night we had together). This morning, I had an awful nightmare. Like the wake up screaming, hands shaking so bad you can't dial the phone kind. But it wasn't about him. I dreamt my brother (my last surviving close relative) had a horrible boating accident and I saw him die. When I awoke, I couldn't tell if it was real or dreamt. I called him in a panic, only half awake, screaming and crying into the phone. I'm afraid what tonight will hold. So I'm sitting awake at 4 am on Reddit, afraid to go to bed.
So I received a 14-game suspension in League of Legends for toxicity. I was spewing toxic venom from my keyboard because my teammtes were shittalkking me and I exploded. ffs I've only been playing this game for a month. I'm dead sick of people being rude, mean-ass shitheads everywhere I go. Why can't there be civility? This game is seriously pissing me off, legit elevating my blood pressure. And I KNOW I can be the better person and, in hindsight, I'm extremely disappointed myself for losing my shit. I wish I could be cool, calm, and collected and not an emotional wreck when it comes to games.
I've been trying for over a year to get my coloring books to sell - not even like No.1, just anything to sell and have some residual income and though my designs are solid, my marketing knowledge is terrible. Not one to get deterred, I sign up for some marketing courses... and join some coloring book author "support" groups where everyone is gushing about how they're making 4-figures a month selling their books and that with grit and determination, you can too! &gt;.&gt; So I put in my time, I build my website, I pay for and take more courses, I do everything I'm told and if I've made $400 in the year since this fiasco began, that's too much. I feel duped by those charlatans touting how their service/product/method will help teach me how to sell my books! I've asked, I've tried pairing up with other authors, I've thrown money at FB ads (I would have done better burning my money instead for all the good that did) and still nothing! Whenever I've gone back to those "teachers" to see about having them actually help me pinpoint why their method isn't working for me, they make it seem like I am the densest person on the planet. If I knew what I was doing, I wouldn't need your shill of a webinar you hacks! I HATE THEM for all the garbage they sold and I'm angry at myself for believing their pie in the sky promises and for buying their crap!!! They've all been snake oil salesmen (and women) and I've been the sucker to keep buying!!!!!!!! GRRRRRRR!!!!!! AND I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO SELL THESE BOOKS!!! GAH!
So, I'm not in any serious distress. But I do feel strangely empty. My BF of 4 years just left this morning for a business trip. He comes back at the end of the week. There will likely be many many more business trips in his future. I live with him, and now that he's gone, I find myself really unsettled with the quiet and loneliness. For background, I need to say that I have never lived alone. I went from living with my parents to living with roommates in dorms to moving in with my BF. And I know I'll be fine, but I've been really uncomfortable. I came home to my empty silent room and am putting off going to sleep. I'm almost afraid to go to sleep. I'm not used to sleeping in a room alone with no one else around. I sound like a baby, I know. I just don't know how I'm going to handle future business trips. My BF's career will involve travel, and I won't be able to go. I just have to deal with being left behind. Does anyone have any advice for dealing with loneliness? These feelings aren't normal, right? --- **tl;dr**: BF just left for business trip, I'm lonely and uncomfortable and seeking advice for the future.
My friends have this thing where they like to see every Marvel movie at the same movie theater. It's a tradition of theirs, so I go along with it. Do I love the theater? No, but it's alright. So we started a while ago planning to get our tickets for Doctor Strange. I told them opening was early November, but they said they thought it was mid-November. Whatever. She's the one with the membership to that theater. She buys the tickets...with my credit card. So last week she says tickets are available, and shows the that, for some reason, opening night the theater is empty. You know, opening night November 16. So I reluctantly put my credit card information in and they buy the tickets. Fast forward to today when I get a text saying there's early screenings on November 3. Wow...who would have thought? Of course they're sold out at that theater for the first 5 days. I want my money back.
Me and my ex partner finished a couple of months back after 6 years of being in a relationship. It grew quite toxic in the end and it ended quite bad. I've moved on and got myself in great shape and spent a lot of time working on myself. The one thing thst has stuck with me though, is during our time together she would always call me ugly. It was her go to insult to constantly call me ugly. I've always been self conscious about my looks but no matter what I try and think positive about my looks, I just think im ugly. It's like I've had it programmed into my mind and I hear her constantly tell me thst I'm ugly when I look in the mirror. I'm in the best shape of my life and had the body I've always dreamed of but I can't help feeling so ugly to the point I cannot bare to look in the mirror but sometimes I find myself just looking at myself trying anything to make myself look attractive but I can't help but be programmed to look ugly. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Is there anyway I can get over this? TLDR; ex partner called me ugly none stop if we ever argued and it's programmed in my mind thst I am ugly.
I'm new here. I'm new to being unwell in this way. In this last year I've gone from completely functioning to being almost unable to leave the house. I've been medicated and I'm going through councilling (reluctantly) which I feel may be making me worse. I haven't worked in almost a month. I've been independent financially and in every other way since I was 17. I'm now 24. I've realized how much anger I've been carrying for so long, and how incredibly scared I am every day. I'm so defensive now. Everyone I meet I manage to find a reason not to like them, and everything that happens I feel is my fault, or is people attacking me. I'm entirely crawling into myself and I don't know how to stop. This is hugely affecting myself and my partner, as well as my bank balance. Any insight would be great. I'm tired of hating everything. I can't live my life at current.
We have been dating for about four months but we had been talking for at least three before that, anyway for the past couple weeks its been pretty stressful for her, she's honestly had a full plate of homework, dealing with me and so much just going on around her. She thought about breaking up for awhile and she let me know. On Friday she came to a decision and I just knew it was coming and I just didn't want to believe it. So last night we caught up and hung out one last time as a couple and she let me know that she feels like she is making the wrong choice and that after school she wants me back but thats eight months away. We also ended up as friends with benefits which is fine i'm not complaining. Anyway I really want to wait for her to finish because i'm just getting this feeling that I really should like I still really feel for this girl and this time with her has been some of the best time i've had with anyone, there has always been something about her that set her aside from other and thats why I want to wait but i'm worried if she would move on or find some other guy and I don't want to get hurt again so I really just don't know what I should do. --- **TL;DR;** My girlfriend broke up with me and wants me back when she has finished school, should I wait?
My roommate is extremely young and irriesponsible. When we first started living together everything was fine. The cat wasnt having an issue with our two cats at the time and wasnt destroying the house. Six months later one of our cats has passed and we have a new kitten. The cat is not getting along with the new kitten but we keep them seprate and it isnt an issue. However my roommates cat has started to destroy things in the house. This started after my older cat died so it isnt the kitten. He has destroyed the downstairs blinds and now has destroyed her carpet into her room. This wasnt an issue because the downstairs is hers to deal with not me and my significant others. The cat has now started to destory the upstairs which is under our name. My question is how do I handle this conversation on the issue of payment because he has wreaked our things. The deposit is gone at this point and he has started to ruin more and more things. Thanks in advance! **tl;dr**: Roommate has a cat that has destroyed the carpet upstairs and downstairs. How do I handle the conversation and payment of ruined items.
My girlfriend (18F) is beginning to have doubts - she still loves me but is having there are other factors (distance, major life events, etc,) that are taking a toll on our relationship. We've been together for a year, and I know it might not seem worth it to work on young love, but we have a mature relationship for our age - I supported her through her sister's death and she helped me seek treatment for my mental illness. We both want to work through it but I am still worried. In your experience, is there hope? Any advice? TDLR: my girlfriend and I (18F) have hit a rocky point after just over a year because she is experiencing doubts, but we both want to work through it. Is there hope? Advice? (Reposted because I was missing a TLDR)
It's gotten to the point where my best friend who loves and cares about me more than I ever thought a person could has become a beacon of anger and resentment. All I think about are the problems I have with her. The good things between us hold no weight. I fantasize about guilt tripping her. I do this even while I anxiously wait and hope for her to message me on skype. She's convinced me that she'll always be there so I've convinced myself nothing I do will have no consequence. My mom is a sad psychological cripple. My yoga teacher is a peppy feel-good asshole. My old roommates are status obsessed monsters. Every woman I will ever get with will have settled for me and all the women who've shown me attention are the exception and not the rule. Everything fucking sucks. The good things don't matter. The times I've been happy never happened.
About two and a half weeks ago, me and my girlfriend who I'd been dating for nearly 8 months ended up breaking up. Not only was it the longest relationship I've had so far, it was the first I'd had in about 5 years, and the first where I was in love with someone who loved me back. I lost my virginity to her not long after we started dating, and I'm happy that she was my first. I'm currently in the process of moving on, and while I've now accepted that we aren't getting back together, the pain is still there and I've still got a long way to go before moving on. I know that, eventually, I will find someone else once I'm ready and will have sex with them as well. However, right now the thought of sleeping with someone that isn't her makes me feel sad as well as sick. Is this normal? TL:DR; me and the girl I lost my virginity to broke up 2 and a half weeks ago, and I feel sad when I think about sleeping with someone that isn't her. Is this normal?
Have you ever felt sad, so sad, you just want to shut down and forget the world? But you can't, because you have responsibilities, and you know there's no choice but to continue on? yeah, I'm sure you do. but dang, I feel like I want to cry, but my tears aren't there. my voice swallowed down, my eyes feel strained, I don't want to do this. I want to shut down and forget, but tomorrow will come and the workload will pile up and sadness will creep on me, then it's a continuous cycle until I decide to get my sh\*t together. It's tiring. Right now I feel sad.
I have very strong feelings for a friend who is in a long term relationship. She shares these feelings with me but want's to try hang onto her current relationship Her relationship is in a very bad state but she's afraid to leave him because of how much she's invested into it. He treats her very badly and she is very unhappy. It may end soon or it could stay the same way for a long time. What should I do with this situation? One side of me says continue to be there for her as a friend and see what happens. This is what i'm currently doing but it's a very heavy burden to carry and it hurts not being able to be there for her in the ways her partner isn't. One side of me says cut all ties because it hurts a lot not being able to be with her and while she does have feelings for me she still prefers to stay with her current relationship. Once my feelings have resided I could rekindle the friendship. My fear is she will become available right after I do this and I'll miss out on what could be something great. I'm there for her as a friend and we have never gone over any boundaries and discuss her relationship often. We are very important to each others mental health as we both suffer from anxiety/depression. Losing her as a friend would hurt alot. So quite complicated. --- **tl;dr** Have mutual strong feelings for someone in a relationship. It may end soon it may not. What do I do?
I haven't truly been happy for a few years now, but I do feel happy in a relationship. But I can never keep one girl, and when I try to find someone new i feel like I always fuck it up and they stop talking to me. I feel like I'm never good enough, people tell me I am but I know I'm not. I hate myself so much and I just wish I didn't. I really just want to be happy. My ex left me because our relationship was long distance and she was talking to some other guy, but she played me and used me as her backup plan. Sometimes I just want to be dead, I feel like no one would really care if I died. The only time I felt like I was getting better is when I had some one who loved me. But when I'm about to feel comfortable and okay again they leave. I don't even know why I'm typing this out for this sub, I guess maybe so I can just get my feelings off of my chest. It's funny how many times I've heard I'm a good person but I know I'm not, or that I deserve love or to be happy. I know I don't deserve any of that. I miss my ex, well I guess I miss having someone love me, someone telling me they love me. But I always fuck it up. I feel so useless and like a waste space. I don't know why I was born, or why I'm here. No one will probably read this. No one will care. But I guess if you did I'm sorry for wasting your time.
I need advice on how to be less afraid of trying to make friends. I have horrible social anxiety, but I’m also just a natural introvert. I have a few really good friends, but I can’t expect them to hang out with me all the time. I used to live with them so I almost always had someone to hangout with if I wanted to, but now we live separately. I feel so lonely now and I really miss living with them. Soon we will be moving back in together but eventually we won’t and I want to feel confident without them. I have a huge desire to make more friends, but I’m so afraid that no one will like me. I know that’s just my depression/anxiety talking but that doesn’t make it any less real. It’s so scary to try to make friends. I don’t want to feel afraid of it anymore. Sorry if this post is a mess. I’m rather upset and can’t really think straight :p
Its about to be the 2 year anniversary of my best friend taking his own life. This community has been wonderful catalyst for new beginnings and the solidarity provided at some of the worst times in my life. I have a message for anyone experiencing this now and in the future you will never forget but it does get more tolerable. I still remember the day I got the phone call like it was yesterday. I was broken for months, or a years even, but it did become more manageable; the feelings of anger, sadness, and emptiness. I won't lie to you I still have those feelings today especially during this month. There were days that seemed fine, then a song would come on, or even hearing a stranger's laugh that felt oh so familiar would send me on a downward spiral. I urge the people experiencing this for the first time, let yourself feel. The only way to heal through these types of experience is to let it all out. At the end of the day the only thing I really have to say is be strong for the ones that couldn't be and you are not ALONE.
In relation to my last post. I just want to share my view on anger. Anger can come from both emotional and physical wellbeing. When i learnt that anger can actually be caused by damage to the brain which leaves people unable to control their impulses, i started to understand anger a bit more. I am still scared of angry people but this really gave me empathy for angry people because i learnt that it can actually be a processing pathway in the brain that causes you to not be able to control your angry impulses. I used to think it was just illogical to be angry and i'm sorry if you have come across anyone who thinks that way! Truely didn't understand. I am not a very angry person most of the time people ask me why i'm not angry, i just say well i weighed it up and whats the point. But i have my fair share of problems don't you worry about that! Just anger isn't one of them. It's puts me at a bit of a disadvantage cause i'm not too sensitive to what makes people angry, cause it wouldn't make me angry? I just wanted to share because if you are struggling with Anger, maybe give yourself a bit of a break. You might have things going on in your brain that makes you angry at irrational things.
Soon it will be 2 years since my daughter(14) was murdered. I’m beginning to see the long term damage it’s done. More issues keep surfacing. I have a hard time communicating my thoughts verbally, about anything. I end up stammering, or word vomit, or just going blank. It’s very frustrating. I can’t focus on one thing for very long. When I try to do anything at home that involves organizing, or even creating art(which I love) I’m all over the place and nothing gets done. I also get these weird moments of panic about my daughter. She was cremated and sometimes the fact that her body is gone gives me anxiety…as if she still might need it. The reality of her death still hits me as hard as when it happened. People are moving on and forgetting about her - which is understandable, it’s just hard to see. Especially when I see her friends, how they’ve grown. It makes me bitter, and I hate that. At work. my coworkers and people see me, they see that I laugh, and smile and say hello, and are probably thinking ‘she’s ok’ or that I’m strong, but it’s a mask. I will never be ok. I’m just getting better at hiding it. They don’t see my despair. Or how I think of her every single second. They don’t see my pain…and I can’t blame them. That’s the idea right? Keep wearing that mask…..
so about 5 years ago i was taking a teacher internship i was in college and sorta like a sub so the teacher was absent this day so i was having to do work well there was this kid who was very nice but he hadnt been passing his classes well i told him id have to contact his parents and right as i said that he started crying and saying "daddy will yell at me" but i had to tell them that night i get a call. the child died he was beat to death by his father. i cried and quit the intership and i feel guilty to this day its all my fault.
All that's in my head is loneliness. Possibly one of the depression episodes I go through as I'm getting older, even if I am 21 years old, but it gets to me. I have a son, I love him to death, would do anything for him. But his mother... She's manipulative, unstable mentally, and lazy when it comes to cleaning up after herself. It makes it difficult to be happy. As much as my adorable baby boy makes me laugh my socks off. I feel the extreme want of wanting someone who will help nurture me, to be physically and emotionally supportive, and not hold me down just because I have a big heart who wants to help everybody. I just want one person, one lady who would hold my hand firmly while I make her laugh her shoes off, instead of yelling at me for not doing something/doing something wrong. I work and work for days on end to stay away from her, I don't have a place to go, I'm trapped, and as much as I make as a restaurant cook, I can't afford a place of my own. Forgive me if this isn't the place to post this, or if my wall of text is all over the place, my mind isn't exactly clear. Thank you for reading my venting.
I have had anger issues ruin every serious relationship I’ve been in. My previous two partners were a bad match for reasons beyond anger, but me lashing out at them or displacing my emotions onto them certainly made the relationships worse. I’m in a healthy and happy relationship for the first time ever, but I’m still getting angry at my partner for no reason and taking out my own frustration on him. He has told me that he needs this to stop which is reasonable, but after being unable to squash my anger for years I don’t know if I can do this. I’m in therapy now and have tried tactics but it still happens. Should I break up with him before my anger ruins our relationship? Obviously I don’t want to do this but I am terrified I can’t change fast enough for him and that if I stay with him, he will hate me and resent me like my previous two partners eventually did because of my anger.
I haven't had significant anger problems in my past. I could still go 0 - 100 in less time than necessary when younger l, but being a larger guy I've learned to be self-conscious and contain/suppress my temper. Currently, I'm in a very stressful situation. I work nights, my downstairs neighbour is unreasonably loud during the day (walks like his feet are made of lead and slams every God forsaken door in his apt. I've spoken to him calmly before. I'm also fasting 20hrs a day and generally don't have patience with people after I try to communicate with them properly. I work in customer service with a variety of demanding/entitled clients, I'm still fine-tuning myself to the demeanor of some of my colleagues and I'm a hair short of kicking my neighbour's door off the hinges and beating him with it. Bref, I have lots of moments of quick flares lately and my containment capacity is currently think. I've felt the patience threshold thinning over the last few months. (Conclusion/TLDR) What are your tricks for reigning yourself in when your anger is pretty much at your throat? The breathing tricks don't work for me. Anything is appreciated.
My grandfather passed recently and I’ve been having a hard time coping with his death. I moved to the opposite end of the country as a child and did not see my grandparents nearly as much as I used to. We were very close and I always loved spending time with them. Due to covid and other factors I hadn’t been able to visit in the last few years until this past thanksgiving. My grandmother is bedridden and I was so focused on making sure she was ok. I keep beating myself up for not spending more time with my grandpa. I call my grandma frequently because we have a lot in common and I know she doesn’t have much to look forward to being in bed all day. I feel awful for not talking to my grandpa as much as my grandma. He always acted like he was doing ok physically but I should have known better. My biggest fear is that he died not knowing how much I loved him and cared for him. His visitation is coming up and I’m torn about whether or not I want to go. I’m afraid that being there and seeing his body is going to send me spiraling. If I don’t go I know I will feel guilty like I’m letting him down one last time. I don’t want to end up regretting not being there. Could it actually provide a sense of peace or “closure”? I could really use some advice from anyone that has experienced this and what you did to get through it.
Lately I've been feeling a little distraught at how nothing I choose can ever be the right choice. I can choose to eat meat, but then I'd be supporting animal cruelty. I can choose to buy a new cell phone, but then I'd be supporting the exploitation of child slaves. I can choose to get new clothes, but then I'm also supporting slaves. All my life I've wanted a corvette. So I've been saving for one. But recently I've realized that it's very irresponsible for me to buy a gas-guzzling V8 with climate change going at the rate it already is. It just seems like there isn't anything I can do that would be the right thing to do. And this leaves me questioning my own morals. Is it selfish for me to indulge at the expense of some injustice somewhere else in the world? Or should I take responsibility for this cruel world and do the correct things? Overall, I'm just losing hope in the world. It seems like everything is so dirty and vile. Corruption is everywhere, and if I chose to really enjoy my life, I'd be supporting these harsh truths. Maybe more of a vent than a question. I just really wanted to get that out there.
My boyfriend and I have been together for a while now, but he goes to school about four hours away. So as you can imagine, we don't get to see each other very often-- probably about once a month. We try to skype regularly, but because of our busy schedules, it makes it kind of difficult. If you think that this is sad, here comes the worse part: His mother loathes me. Over Thanksgiving break, it was a mess with her because of it. So he's leaving tomorrow and because of his mom being who she is, she decided that he and I have spent "enough time together" over the break so she's going to spend time with him instead. In other words, I won't be able to see him before he leaves. Moreover, I don't know when the next time we'll be able to see each other again except for spring break. He and I dated four years ago and got back together again in August. All of the feelings that we once had for one another never diminished, if anything, they grew even stronger. It's just really difficult for me right now to think about him being so close at the present moment and not being able to see him because of the current circumstance. It's going to be a difficult time until I can see him again.
Idk why I’m posting here. I just need someone to know. I’m dying inside. I’ve never felt more lost. I’ve never felt so sad and depressed. Everything feels like it’s slowly slipping away. I feel like I’m losing everything and everyone. I just think that everyone would be way better off it I wasn’t around. If know one cares whether you live or die, do you really exist at all? I just don’t see things getting better from here. I just want all of this pain and suffering to end. I’m losing my grip on reality. I’m floating endlessly into the void and nothing can stop it. I just wish that I could pull myself out but I have no strength left.
Hi! Im new here. I have a rage and anger issues so i constantly check myself everytime i feel anger. I restrain all my anger for 10 years of my life. I never got into a fight for a decade now. But recently im getting more and more sensitive and im becoming angry more often than before. This leads me to almost punch my 11 year old brother (im 21 btw) in the face 3 times for just doing something that bothers me like tiktok and shit. This anger and rage issues i have become more prominent when im around my friends. I feel like they are backstabbing me. I wanted to kill them but logical side of me don't want to. Unless i don't get caught. But that is kinda impossible today. Recently, i really want to kill someone so that my rage can just go. But i think 1 person is not enough. This shit is bothering me for months now and i want some help. I can't get one now because of this COVID-19 shit. What should i do?
I'm a freshman in Highschool and it's a new school, so I don't know anyone because none of my friends from my middle school went there. I can't make friends and I don't know why. It's probably because I am fat, ugly, socially akward, and have literally never actually had a conversation with a female my age. I eat lunch alone in the bathroom and honestly it didn't bother me at first but now I just feel like a sad fuck. My brother has tons of friends and I always see him getting invited and texting his friends, talking to them. Does anyone have any tips on how to make friends? And please don't just say some generic shit like be yourself, talk to people, join clubs, oh it doesn't matter it's just Highschool... etc because I've heard it all before and I've tried but that shit just doesn't work plus with me having no social skills whatsoever even if I tried again it wouldn't work.
My missed miscarriage was back in October and I was 12 weeks. It’s now been 7 months and I feel like my body is STILL not back to normal… I am constantly hungry, I get nauseous if I try to exercise, I feel like I overheat quickly if I’m in the sun… these are all things that started during my pregnancy and haven’t left. It feels like a constant reminder of what happened and I can’t even do the things I used to enjoy. I loved working out, I love being outside and in the sun…. Now I feel fat, ugly, and sad. I know I sound so dramatic but I’m just frustrated and need some place to rant where someone maybe understands :/ ****i know pregnancy is a beautiful thing and the changes it makes your body go through will one day be worth it but ugh the fact that I feel like I went through the morning sickness, mood swings, exhaustion, and now this current feeling for my baby to never make it to this side of the earth has me feeling so bitter
My dad and cousin were killed in an accident 3 weeks ago - my cousin was driving, and was slowing down behind a tractor trailer that had stopped behind another accident on the highway. The tractor trailer behind them failed to stop and rear ended them at full speed. The accident photos were terrible. I ordered an autopsy report for my dad, and our family’s personal injury lawyer cautioned me against sharing it with my mom. Now I’m wondering if I should even look at it. I’ve been wandering around in a state of shock and confusion. I feel like I need to talk to other people who have lost their loved ones this way . . . just to hear what others have experienced would make me feel less confused.
Hi! I (22F) have been dating this really really great guy (23M) for about a month. We hung out for a month-ish before becoming official. Before him, I was in a relationship for 4 years. It was toxic and bad and it fucked me up. He made fun of pretty much everything I did, from the way I talk to how I am in bed. Because of this, I’m really having issues opening up with my new guy. We were laying in bed last night and I couldn’t even bring myself to ask him what his middle name is because I didn’t want him to think that I’m weird. I’m a fairly awkward person to start with, and my anxiety about all this doesn’t help. Would it be super middle school of me to ask him to sit down and go through one of those “questions to get to know your significant other” type things? Honestly even thinking about asking him to do this with me makes me a little teary-eyed because I’m so god damn nervous. Literally any advice (or questions to ask!!) would be so appreciated. I really like this guy, and I don’t wanna let my issues from my past relationship fuck it up. Thanks is advance :) tl;dr: a shitty previous boyfriend made fun of everything I did, and because of it I’m suuupperrr nervous about opening up to my new boyfriend. How do I start to relax around him?
I'm currently a sophomore at a large university with 40,000+ students. I've never been in a relationship and I thought I'd find myself in one once college started but that never happened. I though in college it would be relatively easy for me to find someone to date because there are so many people at this school, but it turns out I was very wrong. The majority of the time when my friends bring up relationships, the conversation somehow always turns to me getting a Tinder. I've never been a real sport of the idea but I've been seriously considering it because I feel like as a 20 year old, I'm missing out on the social aspects of college. I don't really know what to think of Tinder because I never used it. I see the posts on /r/tinder and they all seem so cheesy, stupid, and fake; nothing I would ever say to a girl. Would there actually be girls on Tinder who are looking for something serious? The main reason I've never actually tried it before is because I feel like I'd just get trolled or cat-fished by guys pretending to be girls. Would tinder actually work for someone in my position? --- **tl;dr**: I'm a single guy and feel like I'm missing out on social life in college. Should I get a Tinder and try to pursue an actual relationship?
As I am sure people say here every post, I have had anger issues for my whole life. I have a long fuse that builds and builds until I am on the brink of self harm. I lose control of my movements and get very disturbing thoughts and this shit is starting to scare me. Today my family heard me walking out of my house after finding my work shirt saying "I just want to blow my fucking god damn brains out" I don't believe I would ever do that, I am way to scared of death too and it doesn't seem like a release to me. I just compare my anger to a hard-drive reaching max capacity and crashing, I just reach a certain point of overcapacity and my angry self says things. I am going to schedule a psychiatrist appointment at one of the best hospitals in my area, even though I am highly anti-medicating. I am tired of my family hating me and being scared of me, it i not fair to them. Time to go get diagnosed as a bi-polar I guess, fun.
Im at a longe distance relationship, and i love my partner so so much But, does it make any sense to be in this rp in the first place? We don't have any plans to live in the same city Its been about 4 months now, we got to see each other 3 times (one week each) And were planning to meet again, this time for 5 weeks Already bought tickets... But i guess im giving up on us due to the lack of seeing any chance of good future Were gonna live like this forever? Im not sure thats what i want for my life Still, thinking about breaking up make me so sad
I'm honestly the nicest guy, even if you cut me up or make a mistake driving everyone makes mistakes. But today someone called me a wanker for no reason when going past me on a dual carriage way I caught him at a stop light at ensured I was in front so I could confront him I said why did you call me a wanker and he said I dont know i apologise... I was extremely dissapointed in myself for losing my coool it's not the first time I once was eating my lunch when a van driver complained outside a shop that I was not allowed to eat my lunch in a parking space at a shop I just bought it at calling me a name I responded extremely irate as I get a very short break at lunch and he could have parked elsewhere... Anyhow I have a habit of losing my temper easily when provoked on more serious accounts which I won't mention here... How do I control my temper I try to breath count backwards etc Usually in the past people have said something which I have took literally eg a man said he would break my face but claimed he was joking after he felt the consequence. I feel like I am on a cliff edge sometimes with my temper...
Broke up months ago. I want to stop trying dating for a while(both actively and passively for virus). People say that you have to enjoy being single to embrace any healthy relationship. Well I agree that theory all the time, only now I found out I don't want to or I can't. For the record, I live a pretty standard life. Nice and balanced job, save monthly as planned. Make the best of my free time: study online courses continuously, work out, play my favorite games, watch sports and movies, hang out with friends every week(online or offline). But I still feel so empty! I want a person in my life I can really talk to, share everything with, care about, and have that deep emotional connection. A close friend or a boyfriend. But face it a friend can never be as close as a boyfriend, at least for me and my friends. Also, because I really want it, in most dating experience I always the one wants deep connection and cares sooner, invest and fall sooner. I don't think it's a good thing either. For those who jump from in relationship to enjoy being yourself, what status of mind do you have? To have a transition from enjoy spending the time and energy you used to share with someone, to okay not so emotional close with anyone? **TL:DR** What's your experience from enjoying deep emotional connection with someone(bf or gf) to okay not so emotional close with anyone? How to stop wanting someone in your life very much?
Being 17 years old, I wanted a cool sporty looking car, so I worked for 3 summers saving up all my money and bought a 2000 Audi TT. I spent $5000 on it knowing that it was going to need a timing belt done; that job costs $700. What I didn’t know is that I would need a new alternator too, that set me back $300. My check engine light came on recently and I went to get it checked at a local shop, they called me 10 minutes ago to tell me that my down pipe is cracked. That costs $700 plus $400 in labor minus tax. I also need 2 ABS sensors that will cost $250 EACH. I’m broke and don’t know what to do, I need the car to drive to work and my parents don’t have a car I can borrow. I don’t know what to do. TL;DR- my car needs ~$2000 in repairs, I’m 17 and I’m broke because I bought said car.
Yippee, it's April! The month of spring, flowers, warm rain showers, newness and… death anniversaries. My best friend died the day before my birthday. I miss him everyday, but the month of April is particularly hard. 8 years have passed and every 12 months, I'm back into my depressive trance. Everywhere I look, I'm reminded of him in some way. It makes me cry and laugh at the same time. And to make this year a little harder to bear, one of my other friends died of a heroin overdose. We were never close but it still shook me as I had no idea he was even on that shit. He has two very young children and had just gotten married. I hate watching my friends die.
We went to visit friends. They have two dogs that they have never taught to not jump all over visitors. They open the door, the two dogs run out and start jumping all over my daughters. They are not small dogs. My youngest daughter screams and runs. A third dog that they are watching is whipped into a frenzy and bites her on the leg, drawing blood. I just grabbed my daughters and left without saying anything. Pissed they can't be bothered to put their untrained dogs away when guests are visiting. Tomorrow I'm calling the health department to make sure the dog is vaccinated. Seeing my daughter terrified and screaming makes me sick.
Sometimes I'm sitting at my work console-and all of a sudden I'm aware: I'm a living human who is thinking thoughts no one can hear, consciously breathing air, just hanging in a balance almost like I'm inside out. I feel so heavy but so numb and light. Sometimes I think im suspended in jello. I try to describe it to my s/o and mom and they just tell me I'm ok.. but it's like I've left for a minute and snapped back so quickly I can't get my sea legs. I don't know if this will be relatable but I needed this out somewhere and not eating me alive inside. Thanks.
I love her more than anything but she wants kids soon and I don’t. We’ve been together for almost 7 years. We are crazy in love and this is the worst. I’m not saying she’s more in love than me but she has more trouble being alone than me and even said “I think you’ll be ok, I don’t think I will be.” This is the worst and what makes it even harder is how sad she is, she’s living alone now in NYC and feels very alone, I just want her to not be so sad. Any advice appreciated. TL;DR is there a way to help my ex manage our recent break up ?
We've been talking for a while and actively dating for a month. The month has been nothing short of perfect for me and from everything I could gather, for her too. We saw each other every 2 or 3 days, spent the weekends together. It was heaven for me, she was pretty, smart, successful, treated my son like gold, everything I wanted. She came by tonight and told me with tears in her eyes she doesn't think it's going to work out. I asked if it was her ex and it was, she said she still had feelings for him. I understand the mentality of better now than later, but right now I'm an absolute wreck and could use some encouragement. This was the best thing that could've happened to me and now it's over. It's been years since I've cried like this.
Hi all - The holidays give me a little anxiety, and I’m met with more over what to get my girlfriend 😂 I want the gift to be special but not over the top. We’ve been together for about a year and moved in together a month ago. I’m getting her a couple gifts, but one of them is a pair of corgi slippers. The reason im experiencing anxiety over this gift is that she wants a dog, specifically a corgi, but we both agreed that at this time in our lives we can’t really afford the time for one. We both work full-time and live in a 3-bedroom apartment with roommates, and long story short we’re just not sure we’re ready yet. BUT, the idea isn’t out the window - and we’re thinking of getting one once our routines stabilize. I want to get her a pair of corgi slippers, but I’m afraid that she’ll interpret this as a slap in the face. Like, you’re not getting a dog but you’re getting these slippers, which isn’t a replacement and just adds to the fact that we can’t get a dog What do you think? TL;DR: I know that internet strangers don’t know my girlfriend personally, but is dog slippers an appropriate gift for someone who wants a dog when you can’t get an actual dog? I don’t want it to seem like a slap in the face. Thanks for listening P.S. I want to get her 2 additional gifts, but is 3 gifts too much? I don’t want to seem over the top/clingy. Thanks again
I've been going to talk therapy + taking Zoloft for about almost 7 weeks now. I started all of this therapy because of my life-long anxiety that came to a devastating peak late last year (don't let your mental health go untreated.) My anxiety is *loads* better. I enjoy my work more, I'm not crying 24//7, I can fall asleep, my thoughts don't circle, I'm not constantly worried my friends and family will die, and I haven't had an major panic attacks. However, I've had *really* intense depressive episodes (especially if I go awhile without visiting my therapist). I've had really active suicidal thoughts (but for now I'm feeling fine). Before the past 7 weeks, I've never truly wanted to die. My therapist said this may actually be progress and that I'm unavailing some feelings and issues that have been masked by the anxiety for so long. Hearing this actually gave me a lot of hope that I'm truly making progress.
It’s been 6 months since you left mom and I. They’ve been really tough on me. One of my students passed from a suicide a few months after your heart attack…but don’t worry I’m in therapy. I’m back to teaching full time, and finally looking to move to a new district. If I get the job, I think you’d really like it. Chris and I are moving in soon too, and Kristin got engaged. Mom is doing okay all things considered, she’s got my cat for a while to keep her company. My athletes have a competition tomorrow, there’s a good chance they’ll medal in sparring. I’d like to think you’d have come cheer them on…you’d really like them. I miss you, more than you imagine. I saved all your voicemails, even the ones about me never leaving voicemails. I hope you’re watching.
Im just tired of life... i dont even know why im posting here, nobody gives a rat's ass about any of these posts or me for that matter. I cant take It anymore. Im nothing but a worthless human stain, someone who ruins everything i touch. My own Mother thinks im a mistake and i should have been aborted, my girlfriend left me probably for the same reasons, her entire family hates me. My own friends dont even care for me. Life just keeps on shitting on me. Im litterally staying at my aunt's house atm and crying, i Want to end my fucking life beacause there isent one good thing about my life. And You guys are prob gonna say "oh you got so much to live for" or some other lie. You dont even know me let alone care about me. Posting here is a waste of time... idk when im ending it, but i am
Well it finally happened. My girlfriend of 8 months broke up with me this morning through text (we were both at work). I called her after to try to get some sort of closure or understanding. This was a girl who had basically worshipped me and I thought I did the same back. She told me she viewed me as more of a friend now and that she didn't want to continue leading me on. I was devastated but understand it's her life and that she was in all reality saving me from an unhappy relationship down the line. I don't know what to say anymore. This was my first girlfriend and was the only person I ever felt fully comfortable and confident around. She was the only person that was glad to be as goofy and dorky as I am in public. I truly felt like I was finally able to just be myself and be loved for it. I've never really had that before. Even with lifelong friends I always felt the need to try to impress them or something. Never with her. And now it's like my ability to be myself is gone. And I've never been through this and needed to share. Sorry
I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years now. I consider us to be very serious and we've discussed things such as marriage, kids, etc. My family obviously knows we both want to be together in the future. I have run into an issue with my dad recently though. I was laid off from work recently and had to move back in with my parents. This has caused a lot of stress as I was used to living away from them and being home again has, in my opinion, caused them to starting treating me like a teenager. I don't live with my boyfriend as we're waiting until marriage until we move in together (our decision). That said due to the stress with being back at home I've been visiting my boyfriend at his apartment more frequently. My dad has explicitly stated that I'm not allowed to spend the night there and can only visit during the daytime. This is somewhat of a problem since he lives quite far from my parent's house which makes driving there and back terrible in terms of cost on gas and how it cuts into our time together (he works crazy hours). I feel like my dad is holding my current predicament over my head (since I'm living at home until I get a new job) and I don't know what to do. It's causing resentful from myself and my boyfriend towards my father. What should I do in this situation? Suck it up until I find a job? Any help would be appreciated. **TL;DR;** Issues with dad and seeing my LTR, feels like he's holding something over me
This one is achingly, wonderfully heartbreaking; sometimes it helps to dive deep into the grief, and own it : Dog's Death by John Updike She must have been kicked unseen or brushed by a car. Too young to know much, she was beginning to learn To use the newspapers spread on the kitchen floor And to win, wetting there, the words, "Good dog! Good dog!" We thought her shy malaise was a shot reaction. The autopsy disclosed a rupture in her liver. As we teased her with play, blood was filling her skin And her heart was learning to lie down forever. Monday morning, as the children were noisily fed And sent to school, she crawled beneath the youngest's bed. We found her twisted and limp but still alive. In the car to the vet's, on my lap, she tried To bite my hand and died. I stroked her warm fur And my wife called in a voice imperious with tears. Though surrounded by love that would have upheld her, Nevertheless she sank and, stiffening, disappeared. Back home, we found that in the night her frame, Drawing near to dissolution, had endured the shame Of diarrhoea and had dragged across the floor To a newspaper carelessly left there. Good dog.
Hey guys, so first I should say I am not officially diagnosed for a variety of reasons that I won’t get into, but I definitely struggle with anxiety and a bit of depression and lately it’s gotten worse. From nail biting, incessantly tapping my hands and feet, to twisting my hair and spacing out while my brain is just on overdrive. Lately it’s gotten to the point where I have a hard time sleeping just because I can’t make my brain shut up and I have very intrusive thoughts and such. I was just wondering, what sort of things have helped you deal with stuff like this? Most of my immediate family has this issue too but they are all on medication and such and I just don’t want to take that route. I’ve tried song writing since I am a musician and that helped for a long time but I’ve almost completely lost interest in that aspect of my life. So yeah any helpful tips or ideas to kind of better myself or just help deal with it would be much appreciated. Thanks!
Reddit. This is so personal and I’ve never told anyone. I discovered my mom cheating on my dad by looking at her tablet and opening up to Facebook messages of “I love you” to another man. They were secretly together for 2 years before I discovered and told my dad. He is so kind and sweet, that he literally paid for her to live in a condo with the new guy because he wanted to keep custody of my little sister during their divorce. Anyways, my mom didn’t talk to me for 6 months after I snooped and told my dad, but when I finally gave her another chance she had the cheater guy come over to meet me. This was without my permission so I freaked out and in her rage, she tried to convince me that my dad is actually gay. I know this is a lie but she did it to turn him against me like she has tried her whole life. I cannot seem to forgive her 5 years later. How can I do this. TL;DR: I need help on how to forgive my mom’s actions...help
Everything makes me angry. Feeling lonely makes me angry. Feeling sad makes me angry. Being inconvenienced makes me angry. Having to do anything I don't want to makes me angry I'm fantastic at hiding it. The only people who know are my last girlfriend (she's dead and that makes me angry, surprise) and my therapist. I get angry thinking about how tiring going to work is because I'm great at pretending to be nice and pleasant and helpful. It's so frustrating and tiring to pretend all the time. I hate it Does anyone have a "new perspective" to look at being angry? I can control my actions great, but that doesn't stop me from feeling angry. I feel wound up and tense all the time. Exercise makes me tired, but doesn't take the emotion away. Controlling my breathing helps control my actions, but not the feeling. I have crap sleep and haven't found a way to fix it yet
So I've been dating this girl for a couple of months. We have not established any exclusivity. The last couple of weeks, there has been a steep decline in the frequency of our text conversations. Then last night, I noticed that she updated a couple of pictures on her Bumble profile (how we met). Obviously I've still been swiping around on Bumble, and she has every right to do so. However, I feel like it's not a great sign that she's been communicating less frequently as well as actively updating her dating profile pics. I texted her last night to hang out this weekend, and she said that she'd like to but isn't sure yet if Sat or Sun is better due to a prior commitment with her cousin. I'm aware that she may cancel altogether; in that event, I'm just going to let this go. However, assuming we do end up hanging out this weekend, what should my course of action be? I definitely won't mention that I noticed her Bumble updates because that's neither here nor there, but should I bring up what our status is and ask what she's looking for? If so, how do I start that conversation? If not, what should I do instead? Disclaimer: I am 100% aware that things don't look good (never tell me the odds!), and general advice is to move on. I've accepted that this may be a lost cause, and my current attitude is that I am already writing this off. However, I figure I may as well take one last Hail Mary shot at this as I do think there might be potential with her. **tl;dr**: How do I keep things going with this girl who is kind of showing disinterest?
I don’t want to get into it. It was basically a story that went into detail about extremely graphic torture, and as a highly empathetic person it affected me quite strongly. Some of you may know what story I’m talking about, and I don’t want to discuss it. I know I’m probably going to have a terrifying nightmare now. I’ve been distracting myself as much as possible and it’s working, and I know eventually I’ll forget this like I forget most things that tear at my empathy strings/anxiety too hard within a day or two. I’m just glad I have my meds to prevent me from having a panic attack. Any particularly lighthearted/wholesome subs I could use as distractions? I’ve been to r/eyebleach already and it’s helped lol.
I'm 24, and I still struggle to shop in grocery stores, especially alone. I haven't been to a big chain grocery store alone in several years. I only go if I'm with a friend or family. I do most of my shopping at small stores to avoid the crowds. Today I need to go to Kroger (big grocery store, if you're unfamiliar) and buy a long list of groceries. I'll be going by myself because my friends and family are busy today. I'm anxious and hate the idea of being around so many people, but I need to go. I could clicklist my groceries, but that didn't work out well last time, and I overspent. What helps calm your anxiety in grocery stores? Thank you for any advice, I really appreciate it!
Last week I came up on a car accident. A car ran into a motorcyclist. No cops or paramedics were there yet. It happened right in front of my bank so I stood there and watched (from inside of my car) as the paramedics came and etc... (There was already a large crowd surrounding him that's why I didn't run over to help) Later that day I saw it was one of my old classmates fathers who was the motorcyclist. He's been in the hospital for a week and today he passed away. I just feel so sad. I had to post this somewhere to get it off of my shoulders. RIP sir. I heard he was an amazing person all around.
My husband died last May. He was big, strong and so wild. It was so hard to watch him wither away to nothing. As he lay dying, everyone would come and go to see him. When he passed, we weren't able to have a funeral or wakes. At that time, I was always going to be family. Now I'm forgotten. Not only did I lose my husband. I lost the only family I was ever truly a part of. Nobody calls or texts. Messages are opened and unanswered. My experience as a lost child and now a forgotten widow has triggered mental health issues. I guess what I'm asking is, am I alone? I'm hoping its not just me. I feel so alone. I guess I was hoping we'd always be able to talk and reminisce. Keep his memory alive together. I gave up a while ago trying to call and text. They all have each other in their grief and kinship. I'm not bitter or angry. I just don't understand.
I’ve been waiting for my new therapist to contact me and it feels like its been forever since I last spoke to someone who cared. I have a boyfriend and a couple of friends but they aren’t the kind of friends I could talk to about this stuff. One of them is my boyfriend’s sister, who is really busy and I don’t feel comfortable talking to her about the doubts I have had while being with her brother. The other is also depressed and attempted suicide a couple years ago and I would feel weird bringing up what could be really bad memories for her. I want a friend who I can talk to but then I worry about what they would think and I haven’t been able to make any new friends since I started college anyway. I do talk to my boyfriend about my issues sometimes but he’s really busy (we’re long distance) and he has his own friends and his own life and it isn’t his fault that I don’t have anyone else to talk to. I don’t think he understands the extent to how fucking lonely and sad I am. I wish I was exaggerating but literally nobody asks to hang out or talk or see how I’m holding up. Even if they did I don’t think I could be completely honest without freaking them out. I’m just really fucking sad.
Hey Reddit, I will try and keep this as short as possible. It upsets my husband that the only thing I wear is my plain silver wedding band. In short, it turned out 14 months after out engagement that I am allergic to nickel! My ring is 9K white gold & diamond and everytime I wore it for more than a few days I got little tiny blisters on the back of my finger, so apart fron our wedding day, I haven't worn it. That really winds my husband up because he wants me to have something pretty to wear as well as my wedding ring. ​ Given that, I agreed that he could buy me a silver replacement engagement ring for my 30th birthday on Sunday. We've had a look and shared some ideas but now I've feeling a bit bleurgh about it. I mean.. he could spend a million pounds on a ring but it's still not my engagement ring. He also won't settle for not diamonds and I don't want him spending megabucks. Any debt is in my name now, too! &#x200B; I also feel a bit ick about him just dumping a pretty wrapped box on the table, given the sentiment (ie our engagement) that it symbolises. It's not going to have the same memories attached to it if it's just plonked on the table! ​ We are thinking about renewing our vows for our 10 year anniversary so in a way, one could see it like a renewal proposal, but I still don't know. We'remarried now so either way, it's not the same. An engagement ring is an engagement ring and cannot be replaced. ​ Your thoughts? ​ **TL;DR- Hubby was going to replace my engagement ring but now I'm not so sure.**
My husband used to say I worried about him too much. This Wednesday will be 7 weeks since I lost him to cancer, and I’m still so worried about him. For the last 25 years since we’ve known each other, neither of us ever went anywhere alone without letting the other know that we arrived safely. Well, he went “somewhere”, and I have not gotten that “call” to let me know he’s safe. Is that crazy? In the midst of struggling to cope with the loss of the love of my life, my best friend, my soul mate, my reason for being, I am also in panic mode worried that he is okay.
Me and my gf enjoy cooking together. Today, as she was cooking dinner, I made some pancakes. She patiently waited for me to finish what, by that point, had been a relatively decent batch. The last one, however, came out bad. I angrily slammed her pan on the sink and threw the pancake away. As my gf tried to console me, I got so upset that I grabbed my plate of pancakes, tearing them apart and threw them in the trash. I have a history of self destructive incidents, but this was the worst one I've had in front of her. She's been understanding, but I wanted to share somewhere.
I grew up in a family with no shared affection. At the very young age, i learned how to be on my own. I'm a slow learner btw, and that made me decide to learn everything by myself. I was self-taught, basically. That's why when i do things, there's always something that is lacking, there's always you know missing. And no matter how i tried, god knows how hard i tried, i just cant do it nicely. I feel like the whole world is against me, i feel like i always have to strive the hardest because life for the people ive known was easy and mine was the hardest. I know how insensitive that was but it is. Im just tired and in dire need of validation.
I recently became close with a friend from Uni. She knows where my mind is at the moment and she just gets it. On friday, I was having a bad day. I was full of confusing thoughts, scary thoughts.. I have been intermittently texting/talking to her, trying to be honest and open about how I feel - whilst trying not to overwhelm her and support her through her things. So, I sent her message telling her that I nearly did something, and waited for a reply. Now, I know me, and that once someone actually understands me and say 'I am here for you', I latch on and I don't let go. I can't help it. I also understand that everybody has boundaries, but it has been nearly 3 days. I sent a message today, just like, 'hey, how are you?' kind of thing, about 3 hours ago. No reply. I think I am just overreacting? But if for a second I thought that the original message would have stopped her from talking to me, I would never have sent it. I can't get out of the thought process. I can't think about anything else. I am spiralling.
I am disgusting. My body is disgusting. I am not fat, but I feel fat because I am skinny fat. That’s a thing, and that’s what I am. I’m also the least feminine. Nothing about me is feminine besides maybe the fact that i menstruate. I’ve tried being feminine, but I then I don’t feel authentic. I feel fake, and unnatural. But I’m not masculine either. I’m just ugh. My body is so gross and ugly. It’s like a cave that, just by looking at it, gives you the chills in not a good way. I am such a waste of space—just a WORTHLESS piece of shit being!! I can’t be normal and like everyone else for the life of me! I pray that I die in my sleep tonight.
So me and my girlfriend have lived together 8 months now. She is not only my girlfriend but my best friend. We have an awesome relationship where we communicate well and we just plain have loads of fun together. Basically, we fit and we fit well. We both have depression and anxiety and she has PTSD. But we support each other in working through it. However every now and then one of us will have a bad dream about being broken up with. She usually isn't affected by it once she wakes up and sees I'm still there, but I tend to dwell and brood on them, wondering what I'm doing wrong and whether or not the dream was a sign this can in turn stress her out seeing me so stressed. How should we handle these dreams moving forward? Should we write them off as dreams or are they subconscious expressions of what our greatest fears are right now? Tl;dr: Girlfriend and I have dreams about being dumped.
7yo Siamese that I got spayed when I adopted her at 3. A little over a month ago our vet told us the dreaded news - mammary cancer, many tumors - some huge - months left. He said even with surgery, he is pretty sure they would grow back quickly or other parts of her body as it’s so far along and spread so much already. Since she had less than a year with or without surgery, we made the hard decision not to do surgery and to love on her as much as possible. The past week or two she has been hiding in strange spots she never has before, and also rarely sleeps with us in bed (used to EVERY night for 4 years straight). However she’s still eating and acting her normal self besides that, just more distant. However before when she had UTI’s she gave no indication she was in pain either, she is very good at hiding it. And today I was petting her and felt a new lump on her thigh, and took a look at her biggest tumor (ping pong ball sized) and it’s changed rapidly over the past few days. It’s now bright red and nearly bursting - it looks extremely painful. It’s bulging so much I can’t even see her fur on it. I am afraid it is time. I don’t want her to suffer through the tumor bursting and then bleeding and more pain and then we would be forced to put her down while she’s in excruciating pain and oozing... or until they get too big for her lungs. I have an appointment today at 3:15 to put my baby to sleep... someone just please tell me this is okay and I’m not failing her. I keep second guessing my decision.
My friend and I had a pretty big falling out, I tried apologizing but it wasn’t enough. It’s my last semester of high school and we had so much fun together, and i’m really sad that we are ending the year like this. I’m also worried that i won’t be able to go to any parties because he is there, and i don’t want to create tension or make an awkward situation. I realize that he was toxic, but it still hurts. I was in no way innocent in the falling out though. I just wish i could redo that day that it happened. I don’t want to end my senior year without having any fun, and he isn’t going to forgive me regardless of what i do.
A page from my diary a couple of days after being forced by my boyfriend. These days I’m being constantly hurt by my boyfriend, who I believed could be egoistic and arrogant at times, but I never believed that he could hurt anyone’s feeling in this way to such an extent. I’m really shaken. I don’t know how to say it. To him or to anybody else. It is really getting very painful to bear when I have to be so close to him. Everything is getting so difficult. I’m unable to do anything. Along with him, another guy who I thought was my best friend in school, who was my friend first, before being my boyfriend’s friend, he too didn’t support me at all. And instead said I was wrong, while my boyfriend was right. It doesn’t seem fair. Still there is nothing I can do about it. There seems to be no way out from these painful feelings. These feelings are haunting me day and night. Even after all this, I thought I could solve everything by saying sorry; by being the one to start mending our relation. But instead of taking it, this one word - “sorry” was used as a weapon against me; as an admission of guilt, as an admission of being at fault.
I'm so tired of fighting with my insurance company to refund the money I paid out for the miscarriage. and D&C. It's been since April. I will be doing so well and finding that bright spot. Then. Nope. Crashing down as I chase my refund. I'm honestly exhausted and frustrated. In part because right now I need that money for living costs. But mostly because I have to be reminded every time I start to emotionally heal that I still can't move on. Months of this. It feels abusive at this point, the pattern. We want to start trying for kids again, but all these things do is remind me that having a baby is for other people. Just upping my depression again once I've finally gotten it under control. All I wanted was to move on. To be happy. To try again and be hopeful. (Oh, that's a hard word since I named the baby Hope. Haaa on me.)
**tl;dr**: have said a different girls name about once a week for at least the past 2 months while asleep For at least as long as my girlfriend has moved in with me I've been occasionally saying other girls names while I'm asleep. Sometimes I'll say it out of nowhere, other times she'll ask me questions (ie 'who do you love'). I'm not saying gibberish either, apparently - I'm fairly fluent when I sleep talk apparently. I have not said any gibberish at all as well - I've said nothing but other girls names. I've been trying to do some 'research' as to what it means - a bunch of them are other forum posts where users write it as a one-off. The thing that bothers me (and my girlfriend of course) is that I've been so consistent with it so far, and it's always girls that we know. During the day I do my best to be very much aware of what I think of - and I don't think of these girls. My girlfriend will tell me when I've said a girls name and I try my hardest to dig in my most recent thoughts for the past week and do not recall them at all. I'm quite worried myself - this is starting to really fuck up our relationship. She has every right to be mad, I'm just looking for a solution to stop talking in my sleep like this and understand why it's happening in the first place.
Ive never been the one who spoke their mind in the since that related to reality Im more of a goof ball that always ends up breaking someone elses heart and in the end breaking my own i let other peoples opinions get the better of me and let love be minipulated by other influences Its not the fact that i hate or dislike the people i breakup with its i love them so much i cant controll my thoughts at the time I always wonder how they really feel about me and how they coop with the break-up but that always leaves me thinking of the past I always think things are going well and nothing can go wrong but deep inside i know somethings not right If i could go back into the past i would change the fact that love is something i should work for and not just take i influence these beautiful women to believe that im the man for them and that i will always protect them no matter what in reality I dont know what to do if something bad happened to them I clueless on how im supposed to be there for a women when she needs it and how to help her when shes down it just all brings me back to the point i dont know how to speek my mind I need to listen to what they are trying to say I want to learn how to love
I hate the way my head works, I hate the thoughts it plants, I hate how real they are, I hate I can’t deal with them effectively. I hate how irrational and needy it makes me. I hate the burden, the stress and hard work it puts on to your partner. I hate that they can’t get their head round it and are left helpless at what to do to the point they leave. I hate myself. I don’t know where I am with my current relationship, she needs alone time. The next message I get from her could be that she’s leaving. She’s made me open up and feel completely different towards her that I’ve never had for someone else. She says she’s happy and just wants us to be happy but feels she makes me worse. She knows she wants this but then feel she should leave me to focus on myself. I really don’t think I’m going to handle it well, if it does end. I already hate myself. I’m feeling an urge to give up that I haven’t felt before. It just confirms to my already irrational mind that a partner can never deal with this. I’m too much. I’m too much for myself to deal with, let alone anyone else. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to say to try and show her that it’s not her. It’s just part of the way I am and currently it’s worse than usual. I’ve tried to explain my thought process so she can understand and see how my head works. But she still is unsure of what to do to help.
I’ve been on and off with many but I’m the one who ends up getting hurt. I’m nice and very caring and would love unconditionally and sacrifice my own comfort sometimes. However, it seems like they start losing interest in me and eventually leave and or replace me. I seriously get disappointed to the point of giving up on everything. I’ve been isolating myself lately from everyone because I feel like it has put me in a very dark place. I was also reminded today that I was replaced. ( some people intentionally try to hurt you on social media lol.) this made all the horrible memories come back. What can I do? I’m slowly losing confidence in myself. I feel like I’m not interesting or smart enough or have the right looks for someone to stay with me.
Which is no amount of time at all. I'm only 22 and I know life moves on and I'll find love again. But I'm at the point where I don't want to love someone else and just need someone to talk to. He was good to me. At least in the beginning. Until he became bitter towards my explosive episodes. We just had so many issues. I suffer from severe depression, anxiety and history of verbal abuse as a child. Outwardly, you'd never guess I had a really bad temper. But the panic attacks, the stress, it was all happening to me. He was frustrating because he couldn't say no to his parents ever. He was a big momma's boy and his mom often chose what he did and did things like pack him lunch every day (He's 23). He'd come to her beckoned call whenever she ask and she'd message him several times a day. I accepted his choice to break up. I called him, over and over, to figure out if there was some way but he blocked me. He's done this before when his mom told him I wasn't the right person for him. He ignored me, blocked me, and told me "I have to do this." I ask myself, how did I make such a terrible decision? Just needed someone to talk to.
I wish I was already dead. I hate looking in the mirror to see my ugly body which is all a result of comfort eating from my crippling depression. Nobody really gives a damn to me, not even my parents and everyday is a great big challenge for me. My sister always has support from the family since she's pretty and good looking, but me? Never. All I do is cry and have suicidal thoughts. My grades are falling and I feel like death is the only end to my problems. Everybody of my age is so happy and I always almost envy of all the love showered by their parents. I really wish I was happier and not being called "ugly", "fatass", "loser" every damn second
Before I start, I’d like to let you know that obviously this is something that she would like, as we were all very close to my grandma. Now the back story, so my grandma passed away in 2017, before my niece was born in February 2021. I found this company that will transform photos into paintings and decided to get one done with my niece and grandma to give to her on my nieces first birthday later next month. My plan is to give this gift anonymously and make it seem like it’s from my grandma. The painting is done, and I’ve got to say it looks amazing. What I’d like to do now is to take my grandma’s handwriting and use it somehow in a card for my niece. Does anyone know how I can do this? My best guess is to scan card’s I’ve gotten from her in the past, and try to find a way to use it as a font in Word and put a card through the printer and have it print her handwriting and give the card that way. Also with the card, when addressing my niece should I use “baby “family last name””, “great grandchild #”, or the baby’s first and middle name? Thanks for any tips and recommendations!
Something’s wrong. Is this Depersonalisation? It’s very hard to explain what I feel but the best I can describe it, is that I feel like I’m completely new to the human experience. I look at myself and at the world and I just go ‘woah what am I, how did I get here, what am I doing’. I don’t feel like a human, more like an alien. Being ‘in my head’ feels strange, I don’t feel like a whole being but rather a seperate entity from my body. Like I’m just here. Like I just exist but I don’t know what ‘I’ am. And I don’t understand how I’ve not felt this way before? Or how I will ever not feel this way.... I feel like a newborn here on earth, very freaky and scary. I want to be normal again. But what is normal? I feel like I’m going crazy or worse. Being crazy would mean I am human after all, and that would give me comfort. Right now I’m just utterly terrified of my own being and existence and physical self. The feelings seem to pass when I’m busy doing things like studying or painting or mostly when I’m with people and I have to interact. But only because I’m distracted. Once they pop into my head again, I spiral and feel like a freak. Please help. ❤️
I just moved into a recovery house. I went out of my way to clean the whole downstairs and spend over an hour cleaning. The very next day my room-mate starts complaining about how the trash is full and then comes upstairs and says with the biggest attitude you couldn’t help me take out the trash? Like, dude. Do you actually need help taking out the trash? Trash is a one man job. If you’re gunna take the trash out because it’s full don’t fucking complain about it. Anyway this guy gives an attitude to everyone and I’ve been so nice to him my whole time here but for some reason that just rubbed me the wrong way and I was fed up with his attitude so I started screaming at him and basically told him he needs to stop complaining and shut fuck up for once and he still wouldn’t shut the fuck up. I wanted to beat the living shit out of him but I’m trying to learn how to control my feelings. Plus, I’ve already got enough legal problems. Oh, not to mention I lent him 50 bucks too to help him pay his car insurance and he is the worst driver. Multiple hit and runs plus DUI’s and he’s about to lose his license thank God. I’ve had horrible run ins with people named Phil seriously if your name is Phil were already off to a bad start. God bless you if your name is Phil.
Hey y’all, I just scheduled my D&C. I have to have it this week before my insurance runs out at the end of May. Anyway I just took a test to see if it would come out negative since my HCG is falling. But now. It came out bright positive and it hurt me so much. I am pregnant with my little angel and he’s about to be taken out of my body. The doctor keeps referring to him as “tissue”. “We have to remove the pregnancy tissue”. I know she’s a professional and has to speak as such but I’m just in a lot of emotional pain right now.
So on youtube I was a talking to other people in a comment section and somehow the marines became the topic of the conversation. I said "My town actually sued the marines." And now people are getting mad at me. It was only meant to be a little "oh really?" I know me bringing up that my town sued the marines is a little arrogant, and I'm going to have to agree with you. I have no idea what I was thinking. And I know more people might get mad at me for saying that, but I can't avoid what actually happened and I need to talk about it. And now I'm getting notifications and I'm too afraid to open youtube. What makes it worse is the reason my town sued. Our ground water was poisoned (unintentionally of course. I'd assume.) and multiple people got cancer from it. I just can't help but feel voiceless. I know and realize that I shouldn't have said that, but I can't take back what I said. It's going to take probably like a week until I'll start to feel comfortable and stop feeling anxious to go on youtube. I keep doing things where I take somewhere I feel safe and say one thing to and it turns into a bombshell of anxiety I can never get off my mind. I wish I'd just shut up. That's all I really have to say. Thanks for listening if you bothered to read this far.
When I get into competition, be it gaming or similar, I am always, always hurting myself. I have way too high of expectations for myself and I think I'll do amazing, and when I do bad I get really, really mad and lash out. It's exhausting, not helping me get any better, and I'm sick of it. It's a wall I'm having trouble getting around and I have no idea how to make it any better. I try not to think about winning but I end up doing that anyways. I just end up crappy unless I'm doing amazing and I know I'm not doing that all the time. I just want to be good and feel validated, but I can't act like this because I can't be perfect. What do I do? How do I stop myself from acting like this? It upsets those around me and it upsets me, too. I'm tired of being like this.
You bad mouthed me behind my back. Talk all kind of shits about me with her when I thought you was my friend. Ruined any chances that I'll be with her. Acted like I'm the one that's wrong when you found out. And I don't even get the chance to explain it to her. But instead of feeling blessed with all the chances she's given to you, you are fucking doubting her, she never once did doubted whatever you do. Fuck you. You had the chances that I never had, the ones that you destroyed. And yet instead of feeling blessed, you're questioning her? Just how fucking selfish you can be.
I've been offered a job - surprisingly to myself - to go abroad and teach English in China. What with having anger management issues, you may not think that is the wisest of moves for me, but a) it would represent an increase in my wage (because I work in that bad a job in my European homeland) and b) my girlfriend is from China and is moving back for work for a year and I'm not minded to going back to being alone (I feel the cold winds of inceldom biting at my feet). Now, I'm on the autistic spectrum, if you can't tell already, and most of my rage centres on slights to my ego, impatience and, regrettably, noise which does not augur well it being China. I have an intense loathing of bass-y sounds, loud talking and whistling. I'm not physically violent but I lash out verbally and swear. Being stuck around doing nothing drives me up the wall, so at least I'm up on my feet during teaching, I figure. I feel like such a bad person when I lose it with my girlfriend and she's called me out for it. But it's happened the last two nights now. If I can't keep it together with her how on earth can I keep it together with a class of kids? What are some tips? Is this even viable? (I'm hedging my bets by looking for jobs in Japan.) I've tried mindfulness, but I'm a little out of the habit.
I should be 11 weeks now and had asked to go early in for ultrasound last week before the NIPT. I’ve had 3 missed miscarriages in the past two years, had a d&c in July. The baby stopped growing at 8w3d. The last ultrasound I had was measuring that same with a strong heartbeat so it stopped shortly after. I have a D&c scheduled for Friday. I haven’t had any bleeding but all the symptoms have passed. The nausea and vertigo were so bad this time— I had to go to the ER for fluids twice. I’ve told my parents and while they’ve been supportive my mother has been talking to her cousin and of course has to tell me a story about her cousins sister in law’s friend whose doctor couldn’t find a heartbeat, wanted to schedule a d&c but she decided to wait and went on to have the baby. I’ve told my mom that stories like that are not helpful. I saw the ultrasound. I asked them to do a transvaginal one also just to make sure. They didn’t see a heartbeat. I didn’t see a heartbeat. After 4 ivf cycles I’ve had a lot of ultrasounds. I know what I saw. I trust my doctors. but her telling me this has made me second guess myself and I hate this. D&c is scheduled for Friday and I’ll ask to be awake for the confirmation ultrasound before the procedure. Thanks for letting me vent. I appreciate you all and this sub.
Ive been dating this girl for more than a week now and we've had our ups and downs that i posted on this sub and another before and she did it again. This morning gf didn't go to college she decided to talk to me, told me she thinks im cheating because i simply thought it was a nice idea to tell her i was going to bed at 12 23 when i was lookin at videos on my phone. She thinks i was talking to somebody else and when i told her what i was doing she didn't belive me. TL:DR: watched a video and told my girlfreind goodnight now she thinks im cheating.
I just got the chromosome testing back from my second trimester loss D&E and the POC showed a duplication on the 4th chromosome/EVC2 gene. The results said that this mutation was of "unknown clinical significance." The doctors said I will need to be referred for genetic counseling, but I was wondering if anyone else has received a similar description for a genetic testing result. In case anyone wants this context, scans looked normal up until my loss, but I had low fetal fraction through 12 weeks and extremely high AFP at 16 weeks. I also tested negative for literally everything on the Horizon carrier screen. My care team has been totally baffled by my array of results. Throw in that they discovered a 10cm intramural fibroid at 11 weeks (which is continuing to make me bleed five weeks after D&E), and I'm feeling like a healthy pregnancy is never going to be in the cards for me. Just wondering if literally anyone in the world has had a similar mix of issues.
I’m so frustrated I could cry. I have cried. Today at work was so stressful that I broke down in front of my brothers and sobbed like a 2 year old. I’m 17 fucking years old. I fucking hate everything. I wanted to punch every customer we had square in the face, and if not for my coworker, I might have. Like HELLO can’t you see we’re BUSY and you interrupting us 5 different times is NOT helping. I hope you fucking choke on your precious whopper and big fish you fucking asswipe. Jesus Christ. And don’t get so offended when I don’t hear you the first time. I’m TRYING MY BEST! I don’t magically know what your order is! I’m sorry I heard “fried and a coke” instead of “fries with no salt” I repeated it back to you to make sure I got it right, and you didn’t have to be so FUCKING RUDE’ NO ONE ORDERS NO SALT FRIES! IM NOT USED TO HEARING IT! I hope they gave you extra salt, because that’s what you deserve. I’m so angry I want to kill myself before my next shift. Who’s wise fucking idea was it to give me 2 8 hour shifts in 2 days?? I can barely handle one! I can’t fucking wait until August when I can move away and never see that fucking restaurant again. I’m going to start a countdown
I wasn't sure where else to get this out because I don't really have anyone I'm comfortable with talking about it. While riding my bike back from work yesterday, I got knocked off by a new driver- I wasn't badly hurt, just scrapes and bruises, but my phone screen was smashed to hell. I need that for my job, and in the emergency situation I had to take my laptop to a pawn shop to make up the rest of the money I would need to get the screen repaired. Now I've got to find some way to live with absolutely nothing for the next week till we get paid again. I know it may mean little to some, but this feels like a very dark place in life right now because of it.
My 8yo cat Muffles had congestive heart failure, so we knew it was coming. He'd been in and out of hospital the last few months - getting a crazy amount of meds - and this last time we knew it was time. His breathing deteriorated very quickly and the diuretics were just not cutting it anymore. The last trip the vet hospital was so traumatic for him that we knew it was time. Luckily we were able to find an amazing vet to come to our place and have a very peaceful end to his struggles. But I am in complete shambles. I've had depression my whole life, and when he was about 2yo and I was actively suicidal. The only thing keeping me alive was the thought of him waiting at the door for me, confused as to why I've not come home yet. He was extremely loyal like that. After my dad committed suicide, it was the same story. Again, this cat and his loyalty saved my fucking life. Now I feel like a ghost. I feel like I've lost what saved my life. But I know, that ending it would not do him justice. He gave me all 9 of his lives so that I can keep living, and I will, little man. I fucking will. I love you so much.
It’s time to say goodbye to my 21 year old boy. I know in my heart 21 is a good life for a cat, but it still hurts. He’s declined so much these past few months and I don’t want him to suffer. He’s been with me since I was a kid, but it’s time to say goodbye. It’s going to be so empty without him at home anymore, but I’m at peace with the choice. Before we go to the vet I’m going to sit with him in the nearby park for a bit, and I plan on being with him until the end.
I used to love the nighttime and the silence it gave me. I used to be a loner who was fine being by herself for days. But ever since breaking up with someone who I loved, I just want to be distracted by noise and activity. I don't want any feelings to come in the gaps in between. The last time this happened, it hurt way too much. I don't want those feelings again. I used to look down on people who drowned their sadness in parties and loud rooms, but now I kind of know what they were searching for. I don't care where I am. I just want to be surrounded by noise and people. For the first time in my life, I am scared of being alone. I don't want to stop typing. I don't want to stop my MP3 player. Not until I fall asleep from exhaustion.
I’ve always been hot tempered and short fused. That’s what my mom has always told me and warned my husband about when we got together. My father is much the same. ( me and him in the house together for 2 days is never good) I have two moods. Angry, and tired. And I’m sick of it. I’ve tried things like deep breaths. Walks/runs. ( can’t run worth a crap tho) Petting the dogs. Watching happy videos. Writing it out. I have long since been banned from punching pillows and throwing objects. ( as it’s the childish things to do but feels good tbh) When grief hits? Anger. Punching walls you name it. ( my MUCH older half brother does the same thing) Slight inconvenience? Anger. There is only one place in my life, where anger never comes into play. And that’s with being a parent. But I’m worried that it’ll be... inherited to like it seems to have been for me. I’m sick of it. I’m tired. I need a change before I end up doing something stupid at this point. Be in breaking something. Or messing up my hands from punching doors. Besides expensive therapy. Anyone have any extra anger management tips? Cause I’m mildly worried I might end up hitting someone at some point in my life.
I lost my dad on March 18th to lung cancer. We had an Easter gathering today. My dad never liked big get-togethers, so he would usually walk around outside to stay away from the crowd. Everyone would usually get a chance to talk to him about whatever. It was so weird walking around and just not having him there. There were so many little moments where I could just imagine what my dad would be doing - complimenting my brother's brisket, laughing at my nephews being wild, getting grumpy in the afternoon and wanting to go home, probably complaining about how long my mom takes to get going. There were a lot of moments where I felt sad, but we were all together. My siblings and I were able to be there for each other and stay strong. But eventually, the sun sets. I spent all day preparing food, helping my brother clean his place for everyone, and hanging out. But now I'm back home, by myself and just missing my dad. The past 2 weeks have had there ups and downs, but tonight, the reality that I'll never get to hear my dad complain about my mom taking her time to get going, or hear him laughing at my nephews playing, or any other little thing - it just really sunk in, and it hurts so much. I don't really know what else to say. I'm just glad I found this subreddit. I know everyone else here is hurting and I just hope everyone is doing okay.
Some days ago my bf’s dog was put to sleep. Even though she wasn’t my dog, I spent much time with her and she felt like family. She was about 3 years old, but was affected by a chronic illness that took some time to be diagnosed because the first clinic didn’t request some exams that could be used to diagnose her. Still, it probably wouldn’t change much because treatment is very expensive and would affect her organs, that were already weak. She had leishmaniasis, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and it feels so unfair that it’s not even something that could be prevented easily and not even be cured. I miss her so much and can’t stop thinking about her. To be honest, I don’t even feel like visiting my bf because just thinking about not having her come see me when I get there hurts so much. I wish I played with her more, bought more gifts, gave her more treats, etc. I’m feeling so empty since she had gone, I wished she had more time.
I can't explain why but blood really freaks me out. Any mention of it, even without pictures or descriptors, gives me so much anxiety usually leading to an anxiety attack. I struggled getting through biology a few years ago and I thought picking chemistry would help me avoid any topics on blood/human biology in general. Currently we're studying organic chem, and my teacher announced that we're going to follow that track into biochem. I've already had a small anxiety attack in class as blood was briefly mentioned and had to leave the room to collect myself. And that was just an intro to what we'll be talking about in biochem. I'm just really scared for what might happen when we're actually studying the unit, cause I can't just leave the class all the time because there was some mention of blood.
Like the title says, i fear the day that each of my family members die. Everyday, i think “one day, my family members will be dead, and ill never be able to see them ever again.” All of the great times i have with that/those family member(s) will never happen again, and it makes me scared of when it will happen. Sometimes, i cant even appreciate the fantastic times im having with them because the thought of them dying ruins the moment for me. Once in a while, the thoughts get so bad that it makes me want to cry and throw up. We play card/board games almost every day, and its getting hard to enjoy them because of what im thinking constantly. In fact, im crying while writing this, and i haven’t actually cried in about a year when my grandma passed away. Thinking these things and writing them down feel a lot different. In a way, it feels therapeutic, but at the same time, it almost feels like im strengthening these thoughts by thinking about them even more. All i need to know is, does anyone else go through this? I want to know im not alone, and i also want to know what others who have gone through this did to stop thinking about it. At this point, its almost ruining anything i do with them, but i know that if i keep dwelling on WHEN it will happen, i wont truly appreciate the great things while they’re still here. I love my family too much. I find it hard to think i could ever get over one of them dying. So here i am, looking for answers. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to anyone who can help me.
I struggle with depression and I think anger issues that come and go. I love to play video games once and a while but they get to my head often and cause me to become extremely frustrated and destructive and leave me in a bad mood after playing them. I have broken cellphones, tablets, cables, and probably 15 controllers out of rage from either video games or problems with the devices. Yesterday while playing Battlefield 1 conquest and I broke one controller by slamming it down in my basement floor (hardwood) as hard as I could and then told myself to calm the fuck down as I grabbed another controller and continued playing. Half a game later boom the next controller is in a million peices. Wtf is wrong with me. Even today I started slamming the tv remote on my couch. Im honeslty embarrassed with myself, I dont deserve nice things I'll just break them. Im always trying as hard as I can to be nice to people and my girlfriend but I am extremely harsh and aggressive when I am by myself. I either attack objects around me or destroy my self esteem. I used to be bad like this when I was like 13-17 and then I got better and more patient and now once again at 21 I am a nutcase. Does anyone have any tips to help me at all? I cant afford to keep breaking stuff and feuling my depressive personality :/
Today I was eating pizza around 8 pm so an hour ago and once I finished I felt this tingly burning sensation on the corners of my lips mostly on the right corner and after 10-15 min there was a red rash on my lip on the corner of my right lip but im not seeing no blisters form or anything like that of sort just a red rash I remember when I was 13(3 years ago) that happened 2 me again but had no knowledge on how herpes worked but I'm not even sure if I have herpes but what should I do to cure it what should I not do and can I take a shower I'm anxious that if I take a shower the water touching my lips then falling down my crotch might get me genital herpes
Hello to everyone here. My dad passed away very suddenly last month. He was too young to die, I’m too young to lose him. We held his funeral this week. I’m devastated. I loved him, I miss him and I feel broken. To varying degrees and ends I’m speaking to people who belong to the same terrible club- membership is free but you can’t buy your way out as much as you may want to. My own dad lost his own father, who I never met, when he was my age. The pain is that he will miss out on all the same wonderful things life failed to offer my grandfather (a peaceful old age, grandchildren, adventures in retirement). However, and I understand if any of you feel differently, but for me grief is wonderful. Grief makes you kinder, and more intelligent. It makes you understand the value of those you love, the value of life and the value of yourself. It hurts like fury but it makes you take a step back and appreciate the meaning behind small kindnesses and minute gestures. In the long term, though it’s all raw now, I know it will make it easier for me to open my heart to love and being loved. Grief is a steadfast friend when when times are so rough that the more fickle emotions, like jealously or anger or even joy leave you behind. It is second in importance only to love. Where I live, a terrible discount supermarket occasionally sells an incredibly off brand and revolting “Duff” beer. My dad bought it for me every time he saw it because he knew I liked the Simpsons. I’ll drink some in his honour.
Recently, I was part of an invite email for a weekend of friends gathering in some rented house. From the time I saw the first email to the time I opened the second one, I was already locked out of the plans. Apparently there had been a good many people on that email who had been sitting right next to their inbox. It's nothing, but it does trigger those "being left out" feelings that we all harbor. The organizer who is a friend sent me a follow-up email saying that if anyone drops out, she'll let me know. I don't know why I felt compelled to write the following, but it was satisfying at the time. "Thanks for letting me know. In case someone does drop out, is it still the same price for B-listers or do we pay an upgrade fee? In any regard, I will enjoy my year's supply of Rice-a-Roni and a home version of the game." Like I said, it was satisfying at the moment.
I’ve just come out of a long term relationship that I ended, but I seem to be in a rut. I knew that I needed to end the relationship as I knew in my heart I wasn’t happy, but yet I find myself in a cycle of being happy and fine and then suddenly really sad, crying and feeling like I have no place in the world. It sucks as well because my ex is in the same course as me at uni, so I keep bumping into her, and each time I do, she makes sure to remind me how much of a terrible person I am. This is my first time posting on reddit, let alone the sub-reddit, but I just felt like sharing, as I feel I can’t talk to anyone I know as I’m not great at showing emotion.
Hello, so I've had this job 7 months now and I really like it, I get to walk dogs all day! Today though I walked two dogs and didn't wipe their paws off because I didn't think it was necessary but my boss got a complaint from the owner and my boss just texted me saying that I need to remember to wipe their paws and this can't happen again. Shes super nice and not the kind of person to get mad but I feel super anxious and my stomach feels like I need to throw up along with me wanted to crawl into bed despite sleeping for the past 3 hours. Now I'm heading to a cleaning job and I cant stop thinking how much I screwed up and I'm worried about what will happen when I try to go to bed tonight, any suggestions are welcome, I'm new to having a boss and receiving criticism
I suffer from a variety of mental issues, addiction, depression, possibly BP II, etc. My life is pretty fucked up right now. I’ve overdosed a buncha times recently; I lost my job because of my problems; I’m 34 and moved back in with parents; you get the idea. I’m doin much better right now; I haven’t done fentanyl or crack in like three months, and I have more mental stability than I’ve had in a while, but I still go up and down pretty frequently. I’m doin my best to improve and part of that includes gettin back into hobbies I haven’t participated in in a long time. When I do whatever it is, dove hunt, shoot my bow, shoot rifles, etc, if it doesn’t go well, I feel worse than I do when I just sit at home. I get very angry and eventually sad when I feel like I’m terrible at everything I do. I feel like I suck at life to begin with, and when I do stuff that should give me relief, it just compounds the problem. I had to quit golf because I get so angry with it. It’s like I have no escape other than booze and weed. I just don’t know what to do. I’m tryin to do better, and I feel like it’s impossible to make progress. Anybody got any suggestions? The combination of anger, depression, and self loathing is gonna kill me if I can’t get it together.
I suffer from severe anxiety and I thought that getting a little puppy will help me in calming me down. Having something who’ll love me and who needs me is something I was excited to experience. She was a black and white little baby maltipoo and I only had her for about a week. In that week, she made me so incredibly happy. We bought her (I am only adopting from now on. I’ve learned my lesson and seen how poorly they treat their dogs) at 9 weeks old. Her breeder didn’t have a great environment and she was exposed to parvo. She was happy and cute the first couple days and once we had her for four or five days she got extremely lethargic and wouldn’t eat. I took her to the vet and they told me she tested positive for parvo. We cannot afford treatment so our only option was to give her to a rescue to save her. She’s been there for three days and I miss my baby so much. I can’t stop crying when I think about her. We called them and asked if we could adopt the puppy after her medical services and they said no, that we are unable to adopt her. I don’t know what to do, I want her back. I hope she survives, she can’t go to another owner because she’s my puppy. I was told to imagine myself holding her and letting her know that she will be happy and healthy, even if it’s in puppy heavy. I’m having an incredibly difficult time right now.
So I've been seeing him for about 5 months now. At first I was very cautious because my last few relationships were pretty toxic and I didn't know if I was capable of committing to someone so stable and supportive. But I thought I'd finally got to a point where I was happy with him. We'd been introducing each other to friends/family and I'd been thinking about the future with him. He's always been so consistently loving towards me, and I guess I half expected him to go off me by now or to find fault with me. But even when I've been an anxious wreck he's been so patient and always tries to understand where I'm coming from. I don't know why I've suddenly become depressed, as it happened so quickly. I was feeling fine all week, looking forward to seeing my boyfriend at the weekend. But then the moment I met up with him, I just became empty inside. I felt no enthusiasm at all and it was confusing me. He said he noticed I was being rather detached and I said that I didn't know why. I just felt numb. Ever since then I've been unable to get to my normal self. In the past I've suffered from seasonal affective disorder (winter blue's) so it might be that. I don't know if I'm depressed because of my relationship or my relationship is being affected by my sudden depression. I just don't feel enthusiastic about anything right now and I don't know what to do about it? tl;dr -- I've suddenly come on with a bout of depression and I'm struggling to feel love for my boyfriend.
My boyfriend & I live across the street from each other. We've been off and on for almost 2 years now. I've broken up with him three times where it has been several weeks for us apart, not including the times where we broke up and got back together to next day... Mother nature must be telling me something because all of a sudden my sex drive is through the roof. Maybe, my body isn't happy I haven't reproduced yet? I am not ready for a baby, but it's the only explanation I have for how high my sex drive is right now. So, I tell my boyfriend that I wanna come over to have sex, but I'll leave because the next night is when we're going to get together, as planned. We both agreed that we should spend less time together, which is fine, but a girl wants to get laid!! BADLY?! So, he tells me to pick a night? I can't come over to his place to have sex AND have our night together the next day that's planned? Now, I don't think he's cheating on me, but WTF? Any guy I think would jump on this opportunity? I'm so mad...and frustrated. tl;dr: What's wrong with him/me?
Everything is falling apart and I can't do a thing about it. The one sister in law who lives next door and promised to help me get to the store and stuff is moving. Like now. The one up north of us came and took the car. So I'm stuck. There was supposed to be a fairly good sized inheritance but now the sister who is in charge of taking care of the money says there isn't. I don't trust her. She's the gimme gimme type. But she's in charge. We weren't legally married so there isn't much l can do. I was so hoping for enough to move myself, maybe closer to my daughter. But I'm stuck in this tiny mobile home with horrible landlords and now my only safety is leaving. I've never had to take care of things myself. And now I'm totally alone unable to drive and a ton of stuff I have to get rid of. The sister up north inherited everything (long story) but now she's got the car will probably cheat everyone else on the money and I can't do a thing about it. But she's leaving the work up to me. What can I do? She's got what she wants and that that. What am I going to do? Well, I think I've ranted enough for now. I'll update more later.
Yesterday my little quail died of old age. She had a hopefully happy life and was the most tame animal I have ever seen. She would cuddle up to me and sleep in my lap or hands and never poo on the bed. She came with me on some travels and got to see a lot in her life. I bought her egg from a food store and watched her hatch and was by her side 24/7 the first few months in her life which is what made her so tame. She wasn’t scared of my cats or other animals and probably didn’t know she was suppose to be a bird. She sucked at flying as she would always fly in to a wall when she tried. She got buried on a hill with a view of a lake and I got her a nameplate to make sure she wouldn’t get an unnamed grave. I hope she’s well, wherever she is atm.
No matter how prepared I am, I will always freak out and somehow forget almost everything I studied. This is happening almost everytime now and it sucks. For example I'll often forget special word or date that I had to learn during it, but when I'm studying it feels like it impossible not to remember it. It so frustrating and I end up wasting half the time I'm allowed just freaking out or trying to remember thing because I now what they are but it's like my memories doesn't allow me to remember what's the word for it so I lose a lot of easy point in my final exam. Does anyone know how to deal with this? Is there any medication that will make it possible to stay functional but also lower the anxiety? I also take Adderall for my ADHD so maybe that can overpower the sleepiness from most medication? So if anyone would like to share their experiences on stress during exam and how they lowered it that would be great.
I lost my husband 10 years ago. I have had no sexual desires whatsoever until very recently. I have met someone who has opened my heart to the possibility of loving again. He has started a desire in me that I am having trouble dealing with. We are not ready for a relationship involving sex. We both are working through stuff and don't want the added complications sex can bring to a new relationship. My problem is that there are times when he leaves me wanting more physically. When engaging in self gratification I always end up in tears because of the memories of my husband take over. It is very frustrating and don't seem to know how to get through it. Any advice out there?
My mom died of liver cancer in February this year. The subsequent months have been a series of absences — her birthday, mother's day, thanksgiving, so on. I've handled most of them pretty well, but Christmas is going to hit me the hardest. Christmas was her favorite holiday, and mine too, even though I'm not particularly religious. There was this wonderful feeling associated with the chilly weather, her excitement about whatever presents she'd gotten for us, the decorations. These days, it's in the 60s on Christmas Day, I'm too broke to give anyone gifts, and she's gone. I didn't cry much after she passed, but I'm sitting in the parking lot of a shopping center after completing an assignment for work and I'm ready to start bawling my eyes out. It doesn't feel wholly real — I moved to Oklahoma from North Carolina in 2010, and I'd only been home to see my family intermittently in the years since — until days like this. On my way to work this morning I caught myself about to call her phone and I had to remind myself she wasn't there. I think I just needed to vent about this. It's been hard for a number of reasons, but today is the hardest yet. I miss my mom, and I miss Christmas, and God I hope it doesn't hurt so bad next year. Thanks for reading.
I’m fed up with being nice! I’m nice to everyone and they shit on me in return. I’m nice to people I meet yet they don’t wanna be my friend. And I treated my ex girlfriend like a queen and I bought her expensive things and showed her love and what did I get in return nothing but cheated on! She cheated on me while I was grieving over my aunt passing away! She was caught holding hands with someone else and she wasn’t there for me when I needed her most! Every day feels the same. I wake up pissed! It’s been like this for months!
Does anyone here have an anxiety when it comes to having to go pee ? It just started one day randomly at work. I just felt like I had to keep peeing. Then I kept feeling like my body was just gonna let me go on myself without my control. I have a ton of anxiety and never had bladder problems before so I know it’s anxiety related but even though I know it, it doesn’t matter. Now whenever I’m somewhere without quick access to a bathroom it’s all I think about. I was at the mall with my gf recently and just kept thinking “what if I go on myself, it’s gonna be so embarrassing”. It ruined the whole time. I keep getting this feeling like “here it goes” and I’m convinced I’m about to go on myself and I’m worried that my mind is actually gonna make me do it. There’s also been a few times where I’d be on a long drive and the person didn’t wanna stop so I’m sure that’s played a part in all of it.
I lost my Dachshund mix Virginia at the end of October, she was almost 5. She had gone to the vet about a month prior to her passing for a spot on her foot, which did go down with antibiotics (so vet said no need to biopsy). Later in the month, she started having GI issues and we went back to the vet and they gave her some more antibiotics for a stomach virus. These helped for a day or two and then she started getting sick again, so we went back to the vet and they decided to keep her overnight. From there, they did blood work, X-rays, and barium - and then referred us to a specialist at a nearby emergency vet. She ended up having two ultrasounds and they aspirated her lymph nodes. The internist and oncologist felt that she had lymphoma but the pathologist said it was inconclusive. She was also experiencing liver failure (liver levels extreme spike, then drop) and then started experiencing internal bleeding. She was very swollen and I felt she was not coming back from this. She was at the emergency vet for four days/nights and we had a rollercoaster of what could possibly be wrong, thinking she was getting better, and then taking a turn for the worst. The vet said next steps would be a liver biopsy and blood transfusion but we chose to have a vet come to the house to euthanize, I felt it was time. I am struggling feeling like I didn’t get her to the right vet in time and also because I did not get a confirmed diagnosis. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation and know what this might have been? Or how did you deal with not knowing what really happened?
I always get nervous about my job if I feel like someone has perceived me stepping over the line. I work in transportation and so things don't go according to plan. It can be a stressful career field. I work with airlines and we pay them to ship our freight so they are essentially a customer of ours. Of course one of the airlines fucked up and didn't manifest a shipment. I was upset and spent almost an hour on this one issue. I had to escalate it and surprise! I got the shopping figured out and done. When I left, my SOD who is super chill was like "just another job". And my mind is going "job as in YOUR job." Instead of "job" meaning what we call an order. Writing this out is making me feel better but I'm afraid that somehow I'll be called out because I was upset that the terminal agent couldn't do her fucking job! But I work with life sciences and shipments have expiration dates. And when it goes west to east it gets really difficult (almost impossible to ship a pancreas because they are only viable for 13 hours). I'm used to having panic attacks and I'm not having one, thankfully, but that scares me because I'll be blindsided. Tl;Dr - got justifiably upset that an agent we hired to do a job fucked it up and that I'll lose my job for getting upset.
I'm at the point in my life where I know I have to make a few large decisions or I am going to end up in the same endless cycle. I'm normally a pretty happy person, but i have also always been very emotional. I've gained weight over the past two years and am not feeling too great about that either. I'm sitting here with tears in my eyes but I just cant seem to actually cry, which is really making it work. I am without the normal friends to talk with, and while I could bother my old friends I feel they would just see me as I was in middle school; full of bad decisions and things i should regret. i've always sort of been the 'stupid' one but i try to ignore it and just do well with myself. sometimes its difficult. i miss so many different people but i am too afraid of offending people i stay away and don't bother anyone. the only person i see anymore is my boyfriend who im not even sure i should be with. i don't want to be that bad guy anymore. I know this is vague and im sorry im just so jumbled i can't write about anything. i cant make sense of my head anymore. i just want to sleep. but i hate sleeping because it makes tomorrow come faster.
I just can’t believe it. It doesn’t seem real, and then I’m reminded every ten minutes it is real and just cry nonstop. We got into a fight on Thursday when he left his rehab a couple days before planned. It escalated and I became so mad at him for not seeing it my way, that it drove him to use. The last words he texted me were “I don’t know who this person is, but it’s not the man I married.” I feel like I completely let him down and I’m so so sorry. I just want him back. We only married a year ago, he’s only 27. I’m destroyed right now.
Nothing much to elaborate on. My mother just called me over the phone as she's wont to do every two weeks or so and for some reason, I just got really irritated. I felt like I had been interrupted even though I was just browsing on the internet. These anger issues have been affecting me for a while now. I've come pretty close to breaking my laptop on multiple occasions in the past couple of weeks. Of course, I have more restraint in public because if there's one thing my anxiety is good for, it's ensuring that I don't have any emotional reaction at all by basically being a statue. Nevertheless, I had to make a little effort not to punch my laptop screen in a library yesterday, which I guess is big. I feel like I'm irritated by a lot of things nowadays.
I can safely assume from a long browse on this sub that this is an issue, also with all these dating app around I feel like I'm spending most of my time flirting with girls by chat, then when they want to meet it's one of two things, I either completely ghost them right then and there. Or I get the courage to say sure! And cancel again and again until they get sick of my bullshit. Any tips? I'm seriously lost here. It's seriously unbelievable to me how terrified I am from dates even though I'm really kind of social and not bad looking. Baa
Something that really helped my anxiety is once i read about how someone went to a therapist and they told them its okay to live your life in a way that doesnt affect your anxiety. Their situation was seeing their naked body was hard for them and so showers were nearly impossible for them due to the mirror. And their therapist told them to shower with the lights off and that that was life changing advice. For me movie theaters are so scary for me, i live in America were mass shootings are a common thing, and in my youth there was a bad one for The Dark Knight. I forever was afraid of movie theaters but i love love love movies. And recently I discovered sitting front row (sucky seats) but next to the exit, calms my anxiety and lets me sit through a movie. If im anxious and doing errands, i just put in head phones in both ears and straight up ignore people. If im feeling dizzy or my heart rate is high I’ll just sit/lay down, i dont care if im at school or out and about. I’ll just connect my body to the ground and that begins to settle me down. Whatever germs are on the ground cant be as bad as whats going on in my head ahah. Basically I’m saying, it’s okay to do things a little differently if anxiety or anything else, infringes on getting stuff done. Good luck to everyone, keep on fighting and trying.
I'm an eighteen year old artist/college student who's been taking drawing actually seriously since 2016, and for the past three years since then, I've been getting more angry and critical with myself. I've had two artists who I looked up to before essentially spit on me, and no matter how much support I get, no matter how many compliments I receive from other more talented friends or not, I always find myself upset and worse, enraged. Recently, I was working on some artwork to fix some corrections, only to not be happy with how they were coming out and frustrations kept echoing so much that I punched my screen so hard, it's now messed up and will have to be taken into repair. I'm scared to tell my parents for the most part, considering they know my previous records of destroying things when I'm upset with thinking (I've thrown my phone and smashed my PS3 controller), but for now, I'm worried about what to do with my temper. I don't want this to continue, but I also don't want to stop drawing and prove the people who spat on me right. What should I do to calm down? Is there anyone else who's been in a similar situation that can relate and knows how to keep calm?
I’m 30 years old, started trying in December of 2021. I’ve been married for 4 years and a year before we officially started ttc, I tracked my cycles with opks as I wanted to be ready when the time came. I was so excited to start a family. Even went to my gynecologist for a preconception appointment, whereas my Dr remarked that I’m very proactive for doing so! I guess most people don’t do that, ha. To our excitement we conceived first month! I couldn’t believe it and was over the moon. Unfortunately, I lost that pregnancy at 5.5 weeks. I was very depressed and cried every day, but thought well, most people get pregnant again shortly after so I had some hope. Well, 6 months went by and nothing despite perfect timing and tracking. I noticed my periods getting more painful and heavier, so I made an appointment. Got an ultrasound where they found a submucosal fibroid, it is the rarest of all fibroids and is inside the uterus, which is most likely the cause of my MC and why I haven’t conceived as it essentially acts like an IUD. I have to have surgery to remove it, which means I’m probably benched until the end of the year if I’m lucky. Takes forever to get scheduled for these things where I live, plus recovery time. It’s just crazy that sometimes the people who are the most prepared and ready have all the issues, whereas people like my sister fumbled into her pregnancy. Doesn’t even know what an opk is, “tried”for one month and had the smoothest pregnancy of all. Why do the bad things happen to the ones who are more than ready? Just feeling so bitter and pitying myself today.
Whenever I keep doing bad in a game, don’t understand something in class, get a bad grade or experience any type of failure/confusion, I get so frustrated. When I feel anger in public, I bottle it up inside and/or get aggressive with my body by either clenching my teeth or clenching every muscle in my body in rage. In private, it’s even worse. I scream at myself, shout profanities, punch myself, bite myself, throw stuff, etc. I know it’s not just because I fail or get confused, it’s because I build up frustration from other things I can’t express. Friends that don’t treat me with respect, a mom who doesn’t get me even though she thinks she does, anger still left over from being bullied, a father who never acted like he actually loved me, never treated me with respect and sent me to live with my mom when I was 11 or any other hate I feel towards myself. I’ve been like this for 13 years and I’ve never taken any steps towards fixing myself. I’m just a ball of pent up frustration.
I have had anger issues for a long time but recently, I’ve been punching holes in my walls, kicking my door and smashing my monitor. I have slowed down on the first two but I have actually completely destroyed 3 monitors in a week while playing video games. I don’t really have any anger problems in real life but when playing video games (particularly Super Smash Brothers) I get incredibly mad. I love winning and I try to learn from my losses but typically after a while of playing I’ll inevitably lose to some thing stupid and I’ll get real mad, and then every little thing for the rest of the day gets me more and more mad till i do something actually dumb in real life and destroy my stuff. What can I do to quell or possibly harness my anger? I’ve been told to just step away and stop playing, but that is really hard for me sometimes.
I fucking hate my life. My co-workers are dipshits, school sucks, &amp; I'm only 17 so I still live with my parents. They smother me. I'm not really allowed to go out with anyone or anything like that. &amp; I'm just ready to fucking hurt someone. I want to attack one of my co workers in the parking lot after we close one night. Some guy yelled at me today bc I didn't stop when a school bus had it's sign out. I didn't see it. I just told him that &amp; drove off. Looking back, I wish I would've told him I was trying to hit his kid so the entire family can feel the pain I feel when I wake up everyday. I just want to leave my life. It's fucking miserable. I have fantasies of beating someone until they go limp, or someone beating me until I go limp when I sit in class everyday. It's really all I think about when I'm at school. I would consider it a huge favor if someone would hammer fist my head into the ground until I stopped breathing. I wouldn't want to wake up from it. Hopefully my family would cremate my corpse &amp; everyone would forget I existed if I get lucky enough for that to happen. I'm sorry if I sound whiny or it looks like I'm just trying to be edgy. It's just been a hard week, &amp; I hate weekends bc I'm just cooped up in my room the entire time if I'm not at work bc my parents are so strict. I hope you're all doing better than me.
So I have been seeing a girl for just over 4 months. She got out of a 3 year + relationship in late November, and explained from the get- go that she wouldn't consider a relationship for a very long time. Since then we have been seeing each other regularly, sleeping together, and she even says she loves me. Yet when I've asked about a relationship, she still says she's not ready and it's nothing to do with me. Anybody got any insight as to what this could imply? I've straight up asked and only been told the same thing 'she's simply not ready, as her relationship was heavy' --- **tl;dr**: Girl I've seen for 4+ months says she's not ready for a relationship, wondering if anyone has any insight, thanks
I have everything so bottled up from anything that I have experienced because I have only gotten shot down or pushed to the side for my sister from my parents. I'm having a night where I just want to rip and destroy anything I can find. I have only had one outburst and it helped nothing besides letting me see how ridiculous I can be. I get told that I'm scary when I'm angry and it makes me upset to the point I burst out in tears in the middle of nowhere. I have tried working out but I have no support anywhere I'm just sitting alone and getting spat on by anyone that's close to me besides a close friend. I don't want to burden him with my problems and he helps more than anything. How can I solve this insane rage I just have bubbling inside I'm scared I'm going to hurt someone I care about Thank you for reading.
My OCD and my anxiety are triggered by a very specific matter, let's call it interior design. I could prevent pretty easily to be triggered, avoiding the websites and magazines about that, am I right? Though, when I am able to do it for few hours, ms. Anxiety and mr. OCD start to guilt tripping me, telling me that I must be informed about what's going on, otherwise my house will be ugly and less of value (like this, obviously, the things I will be responsible of are more serious). And I can't resist the temptation to re-open the sites/magazines. It happens all day long. DAE feel guilty when trying to shelter themselves? How do you cope with this aspect of anxiety?
My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years now and lived together for 6 months. Long story short, I feel that I have no passion or sexual attraction left in the relationship. Since moving in, we’ve felt more like friends than a couple to me and we barely engage sexually - this is my fault as I don’t find her sexually attractive anymore. I think she’s cute and she’s not ugly, I just don’t have the desire to engage sexually with her. She has gained around 13kg whilst I lead a very active lifestyle. I have tried getting her involved but she has no desire to which is fine, I don’t want to make her do things she doesn’t want to do. However, I’m starting to believe that I do want a partner who is into those things. Whenever we speak about exercising, she says she doesn’t want to feel like she has to look a certain way to be loved. This makes me feel conflicted as that should be true but I can’t help how physical attraction works. I really don’t know what to do about it, every conversation ends the same with no goal to work towards. It doesn’t help that we have constantly been around each other every day because of COVID. However, we did have two weeks apart and I really enjoyed my alone time if I’m being honest. This is the first properly serious relationship I’ve had. Am I being too harsh and giving up too easy? Should I still be feeling excitement/butterflies when I’m with her? TLDR; I’m not sexually attracted to my partner and my overall interest hasn’t been high. Should I be lowering my expectations for a relationship?
I lost my father 1 year ago and we didn't have a warm relationship with my father. We knew we love each other but it wasn't the father-daughter relationship that I wanted. I wasn't able to grieve him because I wasn't really aware of it at first, I think I was in shock. I am a teacher in pre-k classes and I work long hours. When I come home from school then my husband wasn't comfortable with me crying ( he felt bad for me every time I cry, and he tried to sush me down). Then I lost my closest friend at school in parents meeting. She fell down and lost consiousness and I was the one who found her first and I tried to help but she died anyway. I couldn't and can't handle any of this. I am having nightmares and crying at night. During this Covid-19 pandemic, It got worse. I am trying to keep it to myself because there is no one to listen to me but in the last 2 weeks my husband started to say he could feel his heart beats and I pushed him to see a doctor (he refused because he was scared he might catch coronavirus). Anyway, I convinced him to see a doctor. Doctor told him that he might have panic attacks. And he is blaming me for being pessimistic. He says I affected him in a negative way. My mom won't listen to me, every time I call her she tells how bad my fathers death was. I can't handle this anymore.Please help me, I don't know what to do anymore. I am sick of thinking about my father and my friends death in addition to this, being guilty of my husbands sickness.
Hello, people! ive been having this problem since i ended 6th grade. im a 13 year old boy. In july my gf left me (had to mention it because if u read a bit more u will know why i said it), this school year i was hearing some stuff from my now best friend that my former best friend was talking some stuff behind my back, and finally his cousin texted me some stuff and swearing at me so in the morning i went to him and said whyd his cousin did this and i stopped and blocked every communication with this person. Soon he started talking more stuff behind my back to other people who as well hate me now including my ex gf that now takes me as A FUCKING JOKE and as well talks behind my back with her now bf which is the cousin of this FUCKING RETARDED BASTARD . This guy that started this all, used me and betrayed me pretty much. all the rage thats in me is constantly wanting me to erupt it and beat him up until he cant even be recognizible. Some song lyrics also make me want to do it for example Tay K - I love my choppa's lyrics (not trying to promote him or anything) makes me want to do this because of this text ,,i might just pop ya, watch wat u talking to me" or the line ,,Yoppa have the blood poppin of yo jeans" but in the same time it makes me happy listening to the songs. Also im not deppressed or suffer any mental illness. Somebody please help me... everything would be appreciated. Sorry for the long text and thanks for reading it all.
A baby hedgehog holding a balloon He was so careful with it He didn't want to let it go But he held it too close *pop* Now he drags around the deflated rubber on a string Through the puddles and the dirt It's his best friend his *only* friend His momma told him to take good care of that balloon Right before she was taken away by a hawk She bought it for him on his birthday. He just wants to see his friend *fly* again He named it: " Best Friend." He cuddles it at night. And he says, "Best Friend, even though you're broken too, it doesn't mean that you're not special." and he holds it *so tight*
It's been 2 months since I lost my dad really suddenly to covid. I know everyone grieves at their own pace and 2 months isn't really thaat long in the grand scheme of things but I can't help but feel like I should be better by now. Especially when it comes to my university work and assignments, I feel like i need to just suck it up and do them but I physically just can't. My brain and my heart just hurt. Every time I think about my dad I have a pit in my stomach and my heart aches. I miss him so much and everything else feels stupid and inconsequential. I've always stressed so much about handing in assignments and stuff late but now I'm currently 2 days overdue on an assignment I'm only half done with and I just can't summon up the energy to care. My department did grant me extensions due to the circumstances but we have now reached the time where I can't get any more extensions because marks need to be on the system soon. I don't know what to do, I don't want to fail my honors year but I feel physically incapable of doing tasks like these. I've fallen so behind on everything. If I'm left alone with no distractions I just cry for hours. I think about my dad constantly. I miss him
❕I mean 6 classes, sorry! ❗️ I just transferred from a uni further away to be closer to home, because my parents are my biggest support system and they're super close now :) but, I want or at least don't completely hate the idea of taking 6 classes at once. I really need advice though because I definitely procrastinate, even though I can buckle down and get the work done. I waste a lot of my time not really wanting to do anything except watch Netflix. If anyone has advice on anything remotely related to college or whatever, it's much appreciated!
My husband and I have a good friend that was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer a little over a year ago. Since then, he has been through multiple rounds of different chemo treatments, but from the updates we’ve gotten from him and his wife, it doesn’t sound like things are progressing well and we don’t want to pry too much. Lately, it seems like things may have taken a turn for the worst. As a person working in the healthcare field, I’ve seen firsthand how fast cancer can destroy a person. I recently had a young patient who came in and was diagnosed with cancer, but luckily he had a wonderful prognosis with the doctor very confident that he’d be cured after his round of chemo. I’m obviously happy for my patient, but I can’t help but feel angry at the world. I want that prognosis for our friend so much. He’s been one of the kindest and generous people we know and I just can’t imagine why this has to happen to him. I don’t know what I’m looking for from this post, but I’m just so angry and sad that there is still so much grief left for everyone who knows him to feel. He deserves so much more from this world.
This morning my furnace went out. By some miracle I was able to get someone out to look at it. It's totaled. $3000 for a new one. So now I'm at here after being awake 20 hours, space heaters blowing in every room, worried I'm going to start a fire, worried that my pipes will freeze as it's -10f out already. And I'm thinking about all the things I've put off recently that I'm going to have to continue to put off until I get all this taken care of. Tomorrow there'll be a bunch of strangers in my house, which is old and shitty and embarrassing while I sit around for 4 hours while they do the install. I just can't wait for it to be all over. Maybe I'll try sleep through them doing the work.
Even around friends, I feel utterly alone. It's like I have this cold chill that just seeps through my body and flushes out any remains of happy thoughts I have. I'm there for my friends and I make sure to make others laugh, but for the life of me, I can't seem to let it out what I'm going through. Maybe I don't think they can handle it, maybe I can't handle hearing it, IDK? All I know is, I'm starting to seep into my pretend happy moods as well, bringing others down with my sadness. I've been slowly isolating myself but IDK how long I can hold out before I'm consumed fully by the agonizing pain and lose everyone that I love because I can't be myself.
Fuck all of you for being weak, worthless, pieces of shit. Your nutty ass obsession with me is due to the fact that you know that you aren't half the person that I am. Your dip-shit parents had the nerve to curse the world by bringing you into it. Fuck them for that BTW. I am no politician cocksuckers. I don't give a flying fuck about making you feel good. You want me to be like you I bet, a steaming pile of shit that is flawed, weak, and pathetic. Oh, and did I mention stupid as fuck? After years of living with the retards, parasites, and fucking psychopaths of society, I will say the the U.S. has turned into a steaming pile of shit. It was only because of my genetic superiority that I was able to weather it all. I was hated on my everyone and I still fucking won, and if that doesn't prove that I an a higher form of life then nothing will. You want me as an enemy dipshits? So fucking be it!
I've been going out with this girl she makes me feel so happy but every so often she gets depressed it hurts me because she distances herself from everyone that is close to her including her best friend so she bottles it up and it makes me feel like utter shit the past few weeks we've barely seen each other she stayed over at mine slept and then left the second she woke up and i can't help but feel its something im doing because i tend to over think but I have always told her im here for her and we always have a laugh I'm 20 and she's turning 19 soon and we've been going out for 6 months TL:DR how can i help my depressed girlfriend
Hi reddit, earlier this year, I had a few feelings of..... Detachment, dread, crazy thoughts, immense fear, heart palpitations, this strange heavy sensation in my head. Feeling like I'm dead or dying. Is that a panic attack? If so... I had 3 in a row, 2 days in a row. The ones on the second day were more fear, and a pain in my head that I couldn't stop. The day after I woke up and was scared of everything. I spent a while "desensitizing" myself. I was doing well with my recovery until I got hit with a week of feeling unreal. It scared me so bad. Worse than the panic attack itself. It seems like I'm back to normal but idk the difference anymore. I just feel like something is off. Like I'm on a different time line (so freaking weird) idk if I'm back or still feeling unreal. It kinda doesnt feel like another "normal" day. I think ive forgotten what normal feels like..... I dont feel any anxiety, I go anywhere I want. But then I have all the crazy thoughts, and heart palpitations, and I feel dreamy or off. Anyone been through this? How do you even know you have anxiety?
My boyfriend and I have been together for about 10 months, most of it a LDR. Things are mostly great, we share many life goals and communicate well generally. The number one thing we keep fighting about is his partying. Rationally, calmly, I know there’s no problem with him drinking and smoking with friends usually about once a week. I imbibe less frequently than he does right now but I like to have fun too. The problem is that we’ve discussed that he has addiction issues in his family and he got in a little over his head with drugs for a while but sorted himself out without outside help. For part of our relationship he was feeling motivated to make a change and successfully cut his drinking down to about once a month for special occasions. But recently he’s been letting loose a bit more (again, only maybe once a week) but often when he talks about it I get really angry. I explained to him it comes from worry about him but also selfishly worry about being in a relationship with an addict down the road. He was hurt and said I need to trust him, he can handle himself. I want to do that but then he tells me he’s off for a smoke or buying a 6 pack and I just get so grumpy at him it ruins our not that frequent conversations. Any advice? TLDR: My boyfriend is an average partier (right now) but I worry it will be a problem later and get mad when he is just having fun. How do I trust him? Should I trust him?
I wrote down some thoughts in the hopes that they may help a stranger who is grieving. If you find them helpful, please post and share freely. Grief is a difficult emotion to control. Tears are the physical demonstration of the pain of the soul trying to leave the body. The soul wants to be with the soul that is lost and so the soul attempts to leave the body to return to G-d to be with its lost soul. However, the soul is trapped within the body here on earth. It cannot leave, so it causes physical pain. It feels like a tearing of the inside of the body and despite the strength and the power of the individual, here on earth, he begins to cry inadvertently and unwillingly. This physical reaction to loss is a clear demonstration of the existence of G-d and our connection to him and to one another. Unfortunately, that pain and that tearing will never go away, but it will get better and less frequent. Importantly, we continue to experience that pain and that yearning as a reminder that our soul must remain in our flesh to carry out the mission for why each of us were sent. It’s not our time to leave. So we must stay, we must be strong, we must be faithful, until such time as our mission is complete. We must continue to carry the loss of the soul of our loved one forward, as a reminder that our mission and our purpose, for which G-d has given to each of us, is incomplete. Exalted and hallowed be His great Name. Amen.
I cannot seem to get rid of my anger and it’s making me depressed and self-loathing. I am almost 40 and I’ve been trying almost everything to take control, from breathing exercises to counting to praying. The only thing I haven’t tried yet is actually talking to a therapist for two reasons: 1, I just don’t have much money and 2, I am afraid they will try to medicate me and I refuse to be medicated. Does anyone have any advice? It has ruined jobs, relationships, my reputation... all of it. I just want it to stop so bad..
As I lay in my bed, my mind starts to wonder. I begin to think about the day I have had, to most people this would be a normal yet non eventful activity but for me every moment I let my brain wonder freely, I play with fire. At first things seem ok, happy even, until I start to get off track, images and ideas start to morph into something much darker, that's when the pressure starts. At first it's subtle. A small, tangible build up, one that is easily ignored but like an ocean that's been ripped apart and slammed back together, it begins to affect all that it touches. Now, growing aware of the silent storm, I change the subject to something I know will calm me down, a memory of better times or an old cartoon, anything to distract myself from this feeling but the pressure expands, flanking me from every direction, I'm surrounded!! I reach for my weapon of choice, my headphones, as I quietly state the obvious, "It's coming". I say it over and over but in my head it sounds more like blaring sirens, screeching that horrible warning. I need to hurry, before it completely consumes me. As my finger presses play, I stop. I realize all too late that it's a trap and I have already lost. The song is not a happy one. I don't need to look in a mirror to see the monster that has replaced me. I feel nothing, even as some part of me, deep down inside is screaming, a futile attempt to save what little piece of me I have left.
I read a post somewhere that said something along the lines of, "being a pessimist is better. I'm either right or pleasantly surprised" and I loved that. It was an optimistic view of pessimism. But now I hope so hard that I'm "pleasantly surprised" that whenever I'm right it doesnt feel like a victory. So far I'm right about never finding someone to love, never finding a job I like and never being great at something I'm passionate about and it sucks. Basically, I've become an optimist in disguise and now I can shake it. People say the only way to find something is to stop looking but now I'm constantly looking P.S. sorry that the title sounds like a shitty book
Long story long: adopted a rescue dog and quickly found out she had reactive aggression towards strangers, took her to a behaviorist and worked really hard with her. She ended up biting our landlord, very surface level, and he understandably said he didn’t feel safe. Plus we live with roommates in a shared home and it was becoming stressful for everyone when new people would move in. Tried to rehome her bc we were not in a position to move but had to surrender her back to the shelter when we were unable to find a new home. They’re also not able to rehome reactive dogs so she had to be put down. It was devastating and a decision we did not make lightly/without trying everything we could. We had her for only 8 months and it’s been 4 months since we had to surrender her. So it’s coming up on a year ago that we adopted her. I’ve started crying less but I’m really feeling the grief and guilt right now. I also hate talking about it because I feel like such a failure.
It's because no one cares how I am. They know already that im not really okay, and they don't want me to talk their ear off or lie to them, so they just don't bother asking. Because of my depression, I have nothing interesting going on in my life at all. When I am in a conversation, all I can do is listen. The moment I try to contribute, people lose interest. I eventually just stopped trying. People have noticed that I'm a bad friend, but otherwise our conversations are the same as always. In my own mind, I think my life is interesting. But no one else does, and keeping myself company gets lonely after a while.
For some context, my dad has had long-running liver and kidney issues, and received transplants in 2015. Realistically, he’s outlived every expectation they had post-transplant, but last night I found out that his liver is failing. There’s no real timeline, but this has me broken. He’s been talking about being comfortable with dying for a long time, but I don’t find myself comfortable with it at all. I struggle with accepting that it will release a lot of his pain, but being unsure about how to deal with my own. Of course I knew this had to happen eventually, but some part of me thought he’d just continue on for another 10-15 years. At least long enough to see a lot of important landmarks for my siblings and myself. My mom passed suddenly when I was a kid, and I remember my family discussing whether or not it would have been better to know and be able to “prepare”. Now, in this situation, I don’t think either is easier than the other. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for in posting this, but I came across this subreddit and I thought it may be helpful to at least share with people who would understand. Thanks for reading.
Every time I hear someone talk about having sex with their SO or fucking some stranger, I feel this deep pit of anger, and jealousy, and bitterness welling up inside me. It reminds me of how much of a useless fuck-up I am and how I'll never have that kind of intimacy with anyone. The other night I went to a party and a friend of mine hooked up with some random guy. I was angry that night but when I saw them sleeping together the next day, I couldn't fucking handle it; I had to get out of there. I spent the whole day on the edge of lashing out. I had to avoid my family. I took it out on the wall a couple of times. I wish I didn't feel like this.
Some days it’s like I need affection, I need love, I need companionship. I want to watch a movie with someone, make dinner for someone, talk to someone about whatever I seen that day. Then other days, I enjoy my space, I enjoy sleeping by myself, I enjoy having a house to myself, i like not talking, I like doing things my way, I like making my lists and doing them. I don’t want to be with anyone right now, my heart can’t take it, but I just always feel like someone or something is missing in my life and I can’t fill the void.
Throwaway account. Boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years (or 3 depending on how you count it). Things are going well although we broke up for a year in between because I was unsure if I was happier in the relationship than being single (have been together again for 2 more since then). We both eventually want a family but we're still both in school. Our goals are but also aren't super aligned but I don't think it's unworkable. We both eventually want to live in a nice area and have kids and had similar upbringings. I am graduating this year from nursing and hope to go back for more school in two years time for my masters. He's in the middle of his PhD. I am planning to go to the best school I get into and just do long distance for two years down the road, and then I'll just move to wherever he finds a job since I think my job will be easier to find and it's more flexible. He's hesitant because of our age and the potential our goals aren't aligned. Just to add none of our friends are married and we live in a big city where most people get married in their late 20s or early 30s. My parents got married in their early 20s and are still happily married and his parents got married in their early 30s. Perhaps that plays a role in our views. Are we too young? Should we wait longer? --- TLDR: Have been dating for a while, want to get engaged but maybe too young?
I used to be treated for anxiety, but I no longer need the medication since it doesn’t affect day-to-day life. However, I still have this one anxiety-driven issue. I never really lived out my childhood (low income family/familial problems), and now that I work, I can afford to do fun things. I want to go to Disney even though I’m a young adult with no child. I’m afraid of being ridiculed and that’s stopping me from living out my dream. I also want to do things like use swingsets, fly kites, paint, etc. without looking silly. Does anyone have tips on slowly introducing oneself to doing things “outside the norm” for your age in public?
There's a really really cute girl who I met in my first day in the middle school. I liked her really and we started talkin each other well I felt things r going right so I told her I like her and I got a cute no sorry. After that we stayed "friends". Next year we became really good friends for eachother and I found another girl who I couldn't get for sure (life hates) and now after 1 year friend ship she told me she were wrong about us and we should try. She made so many hint that she likes me. We had an interesting conversation about the thing and she gain over me so I said Okey let's try. I made myself to think of her like a gf and not one of my besties. I reached it I fell into her and after 2 weeks, yesterday she broke up cuz we should stay friends and so on. I think I hate myself because I can't realise that I shouldn't go into this.
Hey guys, I'm 5w post MC. History is MMC took Mifepristone haemorrhaged after 24h needing an emergency D&C and left hospital with a haemoglobin of 104 where I was prescribed iron tablets. Ever since I've had on and off dizzy spells. I went back to work last week. I'm a cleaner at a school that is small and flat, but my boss assigned me to a different school that is 3 story and on a hill. Its a lot of manual labour and I started getting dizzy spells multiple times a day. I told to go home and am now looking for a new job after having a bad spell with a headache. I am now at home and noticing I'm dizzy on and off all day even sitting down. Its really frustrating and I just want to feel normal again. It's been over 5 weeks.
I'm fairly certain that I should be on some kind of medication and see a therapist. However, I'm not sure on how to bring this up with my doctor. I think it's worth mentioning that my Primary is my gynecologist. Anyways, I've been dealing with some degree of anxiety for about 8 or 9 years. (Since middle school) throughout middle school, I had 3 or 4 mild panic attacks. In high school, I had 4 or so mild ones and 2 or 3 very severe ones (in tears, can't breath, face and hands tingling). Over the last year, with several stressors at play (both grandparents dying and my mom's new cancer diagnosis and starting college while working full time), my anxiety has worsened immensely. It's to the point where if I'm home, I'm hiding in my room. More than one person talking at a time makes my chest clench and I feel like I can't breath. I snap at people way too easily and feel really bad afterwards... I don't want to rely on meds and I don't have time for a therapist but my mental health is at stake and I feel like it's affecting my physical health. TL;DR: My anxiety is getting worse with all of the added stress. My doctor is a gynecologist. I don't want to rely on meds. How do I bring this up to my doctor?
This might not be the right place to post this and if it’s not let me know and I’ll take it down. So I’m best friends with a football player from another town so I sent him a text saying good luck and all that jazz. I had a weird feeling something bad was going to happen so I sent an additional text saying “Don’t get hurt”. I was busy the first half but I tuned into the last quarter of the game on the radio. I didn’t hear any mention of his name which I thought was weird but I just thought well maybe he just isn’t playing. The game ends and I was expecting a text from him like 30-45 minutes later but it never came. I just got this gut feeling that something was wrong so I go to his mom’s Facebook page and nothing. So I wait and I’m just running through all the possibilities through my head but try not to think about it too much. Fast forward to 11:45pm I finally get a text saying “Sorry I couldn’t respond I was at the emergency room”. Immediately I burst into tears and wait for him to reply. He has a concussion not too serious but he can’t play football for a while. Now I can’t stop crying. I’m not even sure why I guess maybe I didn’t realize how much I cared about him. It could be that I just realized that if he dies I don’t know what I’d do. I’m also just a bit freaked out because I had a gut feeling about something bad happening. It was probably just a coincidence but I’m just really shook up and I can’t sleep.
The day you lose interest in me is the day I die Come home, to see you without your smile I make a joke, but I never hear a laugh This is the worst possible dream I could ever imagine Apathy is true hatred, it would be too much to bear, To bear the circumstances means that I wouldn't care or at least pretend that I don't I squeeze you rub my hands all over you but your body is not mine anymore you stare at me blankly Doing it out of obligation its not working out When do I stop it How do I show I care How can i change something beyond my control Do I only hold onto memories? Are humans not meant to grow old? I hope we stay like this forever a tacit pact till the end Don't ever stop smiling or laughing I need it to live
Background: We’re both college students and we’ve been together for about a year. We’ve both been super happy together and while we’ve had a couple of minor issues, we’re stable. Issue: She hasn’t told her parents about me and doesn’t know how to. She’s from another country and has lived away from her parents for about 7 years, although she goes home for school breaks etc. Her relationship with her mom is strained because she didn’t get into the school her mom wanted her to go to and hasn’t been getting the best grades here either. My girlfriend feels that if she were to tell her mom that she (her mom) would begin to blame everything on our relationship and also cause other difficulties for her. I don’t doubt that one bit, but I’m scared that as the relationship progresses, she’ll eventually have to come to the decision of either telling her mom or breaking up with me. Of course, since she’s far from home and her parents, it doesn’t really affect our everyday life immediately. Recently, our conversation has shifted from how she would tell her mom (which wasn’t going very far) to if she was going to tell her mom, which has me nervous. She’s expressed that she doesn’t see any way for her to tell her parents, and we’ve recognized that we can’t go on forever without telling them. I’m getting stressed out because I can see that if we can’t find a way to figure this out, then our relationship will end up falling apart. How can we figure out how to tell her parents about us? *TL;DR:* My girlfriend doesn’t know how to tell her parents about our year-long relationship and it’s causing some strain.
I have always been a very hateful and resentful person. Grudges are my forte, although if I hate you, you'll have no idea. I know that I need to be more forgiving and open-minded, but people who annoy me because of their personalities or unethical decisions, or immaturity make me want to physically react. I've even skipped classes in order to avoid interacting with people whose presence makes me fume. Any advice? How did you become more relaxed and open-minded? Is it better to just avoid these people? Is it better to give them a piece of my mind (I might have already) and then avoid them because they're just no good anyway? And just to be clear, I don't hate people for no reason. I get angry when they are unethical. When they're immature. When they are in denial and refuse to change. When they blame everybody but themselves. When they're stupid and lazy and lie to my face CONSTANTLY. When they are complete hypocrites. THAT's when I hate people. Hahaha, all those qualities are wrapped into one person by the way. Ugh.
So a close friend[29M] sent me a message on a crisis he is facing in his new marriage [3yrs]. He is very disturbed and will appreciate great advice, he will be following . Here is the story below: I[29M] don't know whether any of you has been in a situation where an in-law comes for a short visit and finally settles in your home without any sign of leaving anytime soon. My wife's elder sister[30F] who is single came to visit us in January but up till now she has not made any move to go and it's not as if we live in a big apartment so there is no much privacy. I got married to my wife[26F] in 2015 so our union is still young. This kind of situation puts one in a dilemma because you just don't know what to say and you will be termed "a bad person". She lies on our matrimonial bed even in my presence. Before now i never knew someone would feel comfortable staying with a younger sister in her matrimonial home. If it is as a result of accommodation problem or maybe you went to a distant location to do one or two things and you now spend sometime in your younger sister's home, that is understandable. Please what do you think will be the best way to handle this situation? Tl;dr My friends elder sister came visiting and have refused to leave for over 5months now.. dont know what to do. Need advice
Hi . I was talking to my friends about psycopaths . They told me it possible that you convince yourself to be one if you think you are one . For example i think i have anxiety the more i think i am stressed the more i become an anxious person even tho i was the most brave person in the universe . Is that true or is it bias ? . Can a normal person become crazy and kill somebody ? . Because i am scared i become one if i overthink it . Before that we were talking about ocd and that self diagnose is bad . Even tho i had ocd before even knowing it exist .
Soooo i was watching the angry birds movie and noticed that Matilda didnt want to reveal what Terence had done to land him in the anger management class. As a long time fan of angry birds, i have a clue on to why it was unspeakable. Terence is also referred to as "Big Brother Bird" plus he's the same breed as Red. Therefore, i think Terrence is actually red's bigger brother, and Terrence had done something to separate them. It can also explain why he was angry at the world, and Matilda kept it hidden for good reasons. Reasons such as, you ain't gonna know what really happened until the obvious sequel comes out. This is just a theory, the first I've ever made. But no one knows for sure. What do you think? I'm curious af to find out lol
I had my first appointment with a psychologist today and was diagnosed with GAD and depression. I am probably starting medication soon, as well as regular therapy appointments. So I'm probably going to have multiple monthly appointments that, of course, are during regular work hours. I actually get a fair amount of "appointment time" at my job available to take, but I am still anxious (ha...) about missing so much work. Just wondering how open you are with your boss about your anxiety disorder? If you have been open about it, how did they react? Are you happy you told them, or do you regret it? Should I just be upfront about why I need all the appointments? Am I overthinking this and my boss probably doesn't give two shits how much appointment time I take or what it's for?
So I just logged off a game of Hearthstone. For those of you who don't know. Hearthstone is a card based game kinda like Magic. Anyways my opponent had a lethal turn and could easily kill me. Instead the asshole purposely waited till the last second of his turn to play his card. It made me so fucking angry and I still am. I rage a lot in video games. Mostly I just log off or play something else to calm my nerves. But recently it hasn't been working for me. Even if I stop playing and shut my computer off I'm still angry. Have any of you felt rage from video games? How do you handle it?
I am an everyday smoker of marijuana, and I just have been prescribed Zoloft. I have been reading subreddits primarily on what the side effects were, because I was not warned by my doctor. I am currently on my 4th day, and it has been quite the roller coaster. Around the night time, after I smoke is when my symptoms really enhance, the anxiety becomes so strong, I often have to resort back to my room. I have no depression at all, no problem talking to people, I am a very social guy. I am just hoping for some reoccurrence, that it will start to get better, because these nights have been crazy. Thanks for reading guys! I will be ok, and NO the weed is not the only time my symptoms are noticeable.
Whenever my girlfriend drinks I get super anxious. For background both of my parents have had issues with alcohol and whenever people I care about drink I get this awful feeling in my stomach. I'm not sure what to do, I've expressed this to her and she said she wouldn't drink to get fucked up anymore however I still get the same feeling. We almost broke up over it because I didn't want to be unfair and not give her a fair chance because of my experience but I'm not sure what to do. --- **tl;dr**: Because of my past experiences with alcohol I get anxious whenever my gf drinks. Need help on how to deal with it properly.
We have been on and off for the past two months, (6 months of being together in total) and so three weeks ago I broke up with him for real because I don't want to be in an on/off relationship. Simultaneously, I don't want to wake up in five years feeling the way I felt when he stood me up or makes degrading jokes. He started talking to me here and there, and last week we went to the movies where he acted like we weren't broken up. When I went home, i messaged him saying that we were friends and sort of shut him down when he tried to get back together and we havent talked since. I feel depressed to not have him around anymore even though I feel like he was a bad boyfriend anyway. He was controlling, emotionally abusive and unreliable. Those are reasons why I dont think we should date again but I REALLY miss him. He's all I've been thinking about this past week and I just want to talk to him again but I'm too stubborn. So I'm thinking, maybe I should ask if he wants to watch a movie tomorrow? Or would that just be messing with his mind and give him mixed signals? --- **tl;dr**: Part of me hates my ex and the way he treated me but i miss him SO MUCH and so should I ask if he wants to watch a movie tomorrow?
So, i lost my dad afew months ago, the day before thanksgiving. I'm currently in college, and when I got home for thanksgiving break I found him dead in his room. I went through a lot of denial and struggled with guilt and ptsd. I'm doing better now, on medication and went to therapy. Now, I can barely conjure up any tears. I try to make myself cry or feel something but it's so hard. I look through pictures or watch videos and maybe I'll tear up, but i usually just smile and miss him. Maybe it's the medication and just the passing of time, but i kind of feel bad about it. Does anyone else experience this?
TL;DR - Me and gf don’t have each other added, but she’s curious as to what’s on mine. This really isn’t that big of a deal but I’m curious as to you yall’s stances. I’ve been with my gf for a few months now and everything is going good. However we were taking about things related to each others private stories and we don’t have eachother added. She explained that it was really just for her and her close friends (kinda). I’m sometimes physically on it (like she’ll post about me or physically post me on it) but I can’t see it. While I accept her reasons and didn’t really care to be added, she’s been kinda curious as to what I’m putting on my private story, which seems kinda odd. I don’t really use mine much, but do use it sometimes. Do y’all have y’all’s SO added? Assuming y’all have a Snapchat or Instagram.
It really bothers me that I don’t have a set purpose in life and the older I get the less likely it seems that I’ll even find one in life. This has bothered me for years now and I try not to bring it up to my friends or family because I don’t want to bother them with repetitive worries and it’s usually met with a “you’ll see in time” response/dismissive of my worries. I know I’m very privileged to be able to worry about this instead of basic necessities, but I really don’t know how to cope. In the past, eating disorders and cutting kinda “did it” for me and kept the thoughts at bay but now that I’ve stopped those behaviors I am left thinking about it more and just dreading the rest of life. I just can’t seem to accept that we are here to have fun or that there is no purpose. Is there anyone else out there like this? I guess I’m looking for reassurance or tips on how to deal with it bc I’m just tired lol
Thanksgiving 2017 my grandmother up and left my grandfather with her boyfriend of one year that she was seeing behind his back. It blindsided my entire family and was very hard to cope with. December 13, 2018 my grandfather killed himself and it took a very hard toll on me emotionally because I was out of the country and couldn’t be there with my family and he was all I had left in terms of a grandparent. Before he killed himself I had hope of mending my relationship with my grandmother because I could understand why she left being unhappy but I definitely do not agree in how she went about it. After my grandfathers death my grandma did not give one single fuck about it and had no sympathy and blamed my grandpa for everything that he had been going through emotionally and plying victim. There’s no way I will ever communicate or reconnect with her even though she’s been talking to my aunt about how she wants to move back closer to us and reconnect with us. I just don’t know how to go about not having both of my grandparents anymore. I’ve come to terms with my grandfathers death but I have my hard days and just writing this post is extremely emotional and I just don’t want to hurt anymore. Sorry if this post is all over the place and super long.
I don't even really know why. I miss my dad too, but we never had that... Kind of emotional relationship. A couple of days ago I got home from visiting them for 2 weeks (they live abroad, in the middle east), so I just saw them. But it was so nice to see them... To get taken care of a bit, and be on holiday at the same time. I got home to Sweden and it's cold and dark. I've just had such intense feelings of missing them, to the point of crying several times a day since I got home. I'm starting my masters thesis in a couple of weeks, and I feel like it's too much that I don't know. The info from the university is outdated and I don't know who to ask. I'm scared of failing, everything just going wrong... And not being good enough. I just want to "grow down" and hug my mom. But I can't and she's far away and can't do anything. Sorry about the rant... I just... Feel so very alone.
Hey there, Over the past months, I've become increasingly aware of the way my anxiety manifests itself. It's as though there's a level of anxious energy that always exists in my mind/body, and it always has to be directed somewhere. For me, this usually manifests as health anxiety where I'll obsess and worry about ill health in various forms (cancer, mental health, neurological issues, basically everything). When I manage to overcome a specific anxious obsession about my health, I've noticed that after a pretty brief respite of relative non-anxiety, the anxious energy comes back, this time attached to a new thought/obsession. If, on the rare occasion, I have no health concerns at all, then the anxious energy tends to manifest in the form of generalized anxiety (which, is actually much worse imho). What I've come to realise is, perhaps unlike 'healthy' people, this anxious energy flows through me all the time - I'm not so certain that my obsessive thinking patterns are what generates that anxious energy, I actually think it may be the other way around (my anxiety fuels obsessive thinking patterns). The question then is - how on earth can I harness that anxious energy to make sure it /doesn't/ latch on to and ultimately fuel an obsessive thinking pattern? That's a question I genuinely have no idea how to answer, which is why I'm here. Does anyone else experience the same? How do you deal with that 'energy' that seems to exist?
I've always dealt with depression. I can work through that with little problem.(work as in go to a job work) But anxiety is new. But this anxiety is killing me. I don't know what to do. How do people with this issue function? I had always been sympathetic, I had always been understanding... Or so I thought. But no. This shit is 100x tougher to deal with! You people who have dealt with this your whole life .. you are the MOST amazing people I have ever known. It feels like dying over and over and over again. I am researching this but it feels like nothing is sinking in. All my normal coping methods are failing me. Learning has become even harder for me. Living feels next to impossible now. I just am at my ropes end. Anyone help please? I don't know if I can make it to the end of the week. Edit: I am starting group therapy this week. But I don't know if I can make it through tomorrow.
Hey guys. I am not really sure I've done it into correct subreddit, but I guess if one doubts his mentality is ok, it's to post here? To cut a long story short, I have some issues with anger manaement. IRL I'm quite a friendly person, but there are events when I'm too fast to be in a angry mood in a short period of time - it mostly corresponds with if I play a game and I lose. If this happens more than several times in a row, I have to smash my fists several times against the table, and then it all goes off and I'm ok with it. Can this be considered a mental illness? I mean, I'm not ever rude with my family members or rip off anger on somebody, but I always have to smash something in order to become calm again if something happened to make me rage. Thanks a lot in advance and sorry for a bit clumsy description of my problem.
Been going for my crush for a year now... long story short a few things have gone right so we’re close now but she’s second guessing dating me now just a couple weeks after saying she likes me. A couple days ago I said I would give her some space to think about it so everything is fine then. Tonight in a group chat with my friends I’ve been roasted a few times which is usually fine but tonight it hurt a little extra. Then me and the girl were texting and things seemed fine then she blew up on me for no reason at all and FaceTimed me and when I answered just yelled “ya know what why should I?” Then hung up. She was with her best friend for context. Then continues to text me extremely hostile and I just don’t get it. Normally I’d go to one of my two best friends who have always been there for me, but tonight I just don’t even feel comfortable being upset to them. I feel like I have nobody here for me tonight which has never happened to me.
...the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life. A true soul mate is probably the most important person you’ll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave. A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life…” ~ Elizabeth Gilbert I love and miss you my soulmate, my star, my light. I wish you the best HMH
This is my first time writing here, so I'm sorry if it's inappropriate or the wrong place for posting it. It might cause a trigger. I remember that I wasn't too good at taking care of myself in terms of hygiene growing up. My parents would be too busy with my younger siblings, and would therefore expect me to take care of myself as much as possible (we were poor, and both my siblings are disabled). Looking back at school pictures where I always had grimy hair, I can't really remember any friends commenting on it. I do however remember that I wasn't really good at cutting my nails. It would just grow half the size of what girls fashionably would keep them, but I'm a boy. They weren't particularly dirty as I was good at keeping those clean so I that wouldn't get sick when eating–I was just bad at getting them cut when I had the chance to. I was always bullied in Middle School, but I can't remember whether it was a teacher or another pupil that noticed my nails, but I remember that we had a substitue teacher that would comment on it during class, get me to go to the front of class, and outline the length of my nails. He would do this from time to time and I didn't really think much of it back then. The class would be laughing of it, and I thought it was something he did because I should probably have taken better care of myself but now I recognise that it was just public shaming. Now I just hide my hands when I'm outside and have forgotten to cut my nails. I doubt anyone thinks about them, but that's the only thing on my mind.
So where I live we have this massive “fair” if you can call it that, and there was this area where there were a bunch of trampolines that you could go on (it was to advertise them, obviously), so there I am waiting in line and just over an hour later I’m at the front, and at the front of the line there was a sign saying “stand behind this sign” or something like that, as I was little at the time I sort of get pushed just in front of that sign, but I think to myself that it should be fine, I’m only just a bit in front, and the person standing there who directed people where to go even saw me, but no. She sent me back to the back of line and I was gutted. And the stupid thing about that is that I waited another hour after that.
Boyfriend and I have been together and living together for 6 months now. Went to a friend's party and my boyfriend had a couple of drinks. On the way home, we stopped on a corner in downtown where there are just tweakers and homeless people walking and loitering all over. The other side of teh street is the road home so it is expected. At the stoplight, there was this tweaker lady on the sidewalk ( if we opened the passenger door then we would have hit her, that is how close she was) and she was trying to keep herself up but kept going down on the side of the road. BF tried to give her change and I kept saying no and trying to pull up his window, as I was driving, and as I pulled away and kept saying no he accidentally threw out my necklace. I got really mad and told him that he threw it out and he needs to go get it. BF said I was belittling him. That is was not his responsiblity to do anything because it was an accident. I did not agree with his decision to "help" this woman by providing her with change and because he can do/ "help" whoever/whatever he want. Because of this, I "belittled" him. I did not agree because there are clearly other homeless people that are not on the side of the road tweaking that would use the change for something else. I dont care about providing change, I just dont think that a clear druggie that clearly looks like they are overdosing needs change. Belittle or nah? tldr : boyfriend feels belittled because i said no to giving change to tweaker lady
So me 23f and my boyfriend 23m live together away from the town we both grew up in. Yesterday I came back to the town for a visit and met some friends at the pub. For various reasons some people don't like my boyfriend that much. Anyway, my friends started talking about him and then one of them mentioned that he used to work with him. He then said that he remembers everyone talking about how he used to cheat on his girlfriend. I don't think my friend knew, but me and my boyfriend have been together for 5 years and I'm the only girlfriend he's ever had, so if he's ever cheated on someone, he's cheated on me. I don't really know what to do, wether I should ask my boyfriend or not. I don't want to cause a trust issue over something that might not even be true? The way my friend said it was so vague and nonchalant that I don't feel like there was a lot of truth in it. Should I bother asking him if it's true? Tldr friend told me boyfriend cheated a while ago. Should I bother asking him about it when I don't recon it's true?
Since I’ve started working out regularly, it’s been much easier to manage my anxiety, it’s even become my first line of defense. I have completely gotten rid of my heart palpitations, and dramatically reduced my panic attacks. Today I was in class, extremely anxious and panicked, and I just felt the urge to workout, so as soon as I was done I went to the gym and did some cardio, and I feel so much better now. Of course different treatments work for different people, but regularly exercising has completely changed my experience of anxiety, I honestly can’t recommend it enough, especially on top of things like therapy.
When does it get easier and better is what I want to know. I make shit money working two jobs after taxes and insurance. One job is fairly easy but after I work my full time, full stress job, I have to leave and go to my fairly easy part time job. I'm in school, online. 2 year old beautiful baby girl, and I can barley find time to maintain my house and manage time to spend with my boyfriend. I feel like I'm about to fucking explode and it isn't going to be pretty. While I know I'm very lucky to have all that I do, sometimes it's like, "damn, where's my break?". Just needed to vent before I go into full breakdown mode.
Here recently me and my ex broke and we have been off and on for 3 years and this time was supposed to be the last straw. I was the one that broke up with her and I let my family and friends talk me into it. My family and friends hate her but I really do love her a lot and she’s my whole world and I want her back but I don’t want to try and look stupid when this was my last chance of having her. I been really depressed these past few weeks. I don’t know what to do
5 months ago I lost my dearest wife for ever. I tried my best to live and to be positive. But the depression and sadness is intense. I used to have a strong mind. I led her through a lot of our life challenges. And I always tell her that we will make it as long as we fight together. Now that her is gone. My whole world crashed. I realized I was strong only because of her. I could lose anything and stay hopeful as long as I had her. Now the future is dark and hopeless. I follow most of posts here. It looks like grieving is still intense for a lot of people after 10 years or longer. I think I will be one of them.
I work for a veterinary clinic and my co worker is quitting because she hates the doctor. She has a really strong personality and can’t stand working with the main doctor and owner of the practice. She is due to quit in September but all I keep hearing from her is how terrible and mean he is and how he is an asshole. I understand that she dislikes him very much but hearing her say all those things makes me feel so anxious for my future at my job. Sometimes I want to tell her to just shut up and do the job until September when she finally quits. I’m still fairly new to my job so I haven’t experienced what she has and it makes me feel like she is the problem. I just need to vent.
UPDATE: Somehow someway we ended up having a very serious heart to heart and some of you were right. He thinks about the fact that I don't climax and he said he felt like it was a chore for me to do since I don't ever get there. So he just didn't do it much. We're getting there guys. LTL FTP All that jazz. We got married less than a month ago, and have been together for just over a year. We used to have pretty frequent sex, 2 to 3 times a week. It's gone down to about twice a month. He claims it's because his sex drive has gone down since he's reached his late 20s. On the flip side of that he definitely masturbates. Despite the fact that he tells me how pretty and sexy I am all the time, it makes me feel ugly and numb. I'd never do anything outside the marriage and I love him like I never thought I could love another person. But this is putting a strain on our marriage. We've discussed it and fought over it too many times to count. I'm lost guys. TL;DR My husband doesn't want sex but masturbates a ton.
I made the mistake of having some drinks with my younger brother last night. I don't remember the exact phrasing of it all, but it was something akin to, “Dude, you just have to try to get over it.” Long story short, It ended with me grabbing him by the shirt and screaming into his face, “You will never understand this loss until it happens to you!”. This is not the first time he has been completely insensitive. The first time him and my mom had gone behind my back to make funeral home arrangements for my wife before her passing. I do not blame them for that, she wanted to pay the costs, and protect me from having to deal with all that at the time of her death. However, I am not a child and they completely overstepped their bounds, and he refused to acknowledge that fact. He just could not understand why I would be so upset with that, and lash out. It has now been 40 days since I lost my wife, the memorial is tomorrow. I just feel sick with a mix of anger, sadness, and loneliness. I fucking hate what my life has become without her in it.
I don’t want to discuss why I am angry but I’ll just say I have lost everything so I have reason to be. Please don’t judge me as my situation is extremely complicated. Anyway, I keep breaking and ruining my stuff for no reason. I know it doesn’t solve anything but I can’t help it. I need to ruin things to make myself feel better even though it never ends that way. Today I broke a really cute tumbler that was kind of expensive in a fit of rage. And a few days ago I threw out an item I had just received that cost me $20 because I couldn’t open it and couldn’t find any scissors. I have ruined my furniture, clothes, and other stuff just because I don’t know what else to do. I have a lot of medical issues so there’s not much I can do. What about everyone here, what have you broken?
I've never posted but I lost somebody very important to me about a month ago, I've tried getting help, falling people, I just keep pushing people out of my life. I haven't been able to keep the idea that I'm much better off dead out of my mind. Today has been the worst, I'm about to do jt. I have been this way for many years but this most recent event has got me holding the razor to my throat. I don't know what to do guys, I've nothing left anymore. I haven't been able to leave my bed but for a bathroom break or two.
Nothing has felt right recently i have a cold a cant really fully shake. I dont eat much anymore i go to the bathroom like 4 times a week and my grip and hearing and sense of smell are slowly fading... its hard for me to get to sleep anymore and when i do i sleep for 17+ hours. I live alone and dont really have anyone to turn to. I dont know how long my body can take this but i dont even have the motivation to get myself checked out and even if i did god knows how id pay for it... i dont know really know whats going on but it feels better to just accept it.
Hello, Im a semi-pro competitive video gamer, I know sounds stupid but I make living out of it, not much but, it is what it is. Anyway main problem I have is that during "practice" matches which are done in public games I tend to lose control easily, not always but still, I keep getting red headed all the time and keep blaming myself or my teammates about most of the things which are far worse than anything you can do in order to win games, its hard to maintain cool head. One thing that I see that helps me is music, some minimal relaxing music. Do you guys have any tips on how to force myself to stay in "cool" area of brain while me or my teammates make mistakes and not make much of a problem out of it?
I'm genuinely confused about this. So my SO and I would get into arguments and he would apologize but I would still be upset so I continue to ignore/give him little attention him. Then he goes from saying sorry to full out rage mode. He would then start yelling at me for causing the problem and start throwing insults at me. I'm a chill person so I just dont talk while he goes on rambling shit about me. HOPING it will be over soon, but then it has the reverse effect of making him even madder so he starts punching and breaking things. I see that its escalate to an extreme so then I start talking to him and start reasoning with him to stop raging. He will stop and then blame me for stepping in too late.. and pushing his buttons... He's 24, shouldn't he be able to control himself? He's an easy going guy, he's never raged so hard in a relationship
On Saturday November 16th, my house caught fire. Not only did I lose half of my house, but lost 2 of my fur babies. right now I'm staying in a hotel with my husband. My insurance is supposed to find us long term housing so we can live with my 2 surving dogs I'm also struggling financially and I dont know what to do. I have been having a meltdown everyday since the fire. I started a go fund me but I'm scared that it wont be enough. I've already been told that I will have to pay for somethings out of pocket I'm just an anxious, depressed mess and I have no idea what to anymore.
I \[29F\] met my husband \[32M\] of 5 years when he had his life together and was the picture of health. Somewhere along the way he just lost his drive, became clinically depressed, is now an alcoholic, addicted to all sorts of prescription pills, has all sorts of health problems due to his alcoholism and drug habit, and worse of all, refuses to seek help for all of the above. He is very educated and understands what he is doing to himself and he has moments of clarity, usually after a bout in the ED puking his guts out, when he will say that he is going to change. And yet, we keep findings ourselves in the same position from where I'm angrily typing this post - him in physical discomfort from a GI issue caused by alcohol, me needing to tend to his every need and cleaning up after him, ultimately ending in an argument that I started because I am just so angry at him and what my life has become. Let's just say that separation is not a solution. And let's assume that I won't be able to convince him to change or get help, as is likely the case. How do I stop being angry all the time? I feel like a bi\*\*\* yelling at him when he is not feeling well (and he never misses the opportunity to call out my behavior) but I just can't control my anger. I just want him to take ownership over what he's done to himself, to me, and to our relationship and feel some remorse so that I can actually see a glimmer of hope in my future.
I miss her so much and the pain is so heart wrenching. I don’t want to live without her. I’m lonely constantly and the grief I feel is something I can’t even describe. I can’t sleep properly and if i do get some hours I end up waking up about 2-3 times in the night and find it hard to get back to sleep because I’m thinking too much. I can’t even think of happy memories because they just make me cry and miss her more. I just want to hug her, I want her to tell me everything is okay and there’s no need to worry. I’m 23 but the last week i’ve felt like a child who’s homesick and they want to be with their mum. I can’t even distract myself. How do I get rid of this feeling? It’s tearing me apart, I feel like I can’t breathe.
I recently lost my mom, it happened so fast I didn’t really get a chance to process it. I broke down completely when I saw her but now it’s as if I’m trying to distract myself with everything and anything. I’ve been eating non stop to fill this hole inside me and when I try to cry nothing comes out. I’m not forcing my cry, I truly want to cry but no tears come out. For the strangest reason I have had the thought of calling my ex, I don’t know why I haven’t spoken with her in over a year. But it’s like I want to relive old trauma to not focus on my mom’s death. I’m not sure how to grieve. I’m trying not to self destruct but the emptiness that I’ll live with for the rest of my life is discouraging. I’m not sure what to do
I've (19M) been with my girlfriend (17F) for over 9 months now. She is an absolutely amazing girl; she loves me with all of her heart, she always wants what's best for me, she is never mean to me, she would give me the world if she could. She really tries her hardest to be supportive and helpful and an overall amazing girlfriend, which she accomplishes. But I just don't get anything out of it. It doesn't make me happy. (I'm not being selfish, I'm just adding) I'm a great boyfriend. I never lie to her, and I always help and support her when I can. I try my hardest to make her happy. And it works. She's happy with me. But no matter how hard she tries, she can't make me happy; nothing really makes me happy. I don't feel anything towards her. I know I love her, or at least I think I do. But she's away as of now and I feel like my life is easier without her. How can this be? How can I feel this way about someone so PERFECT? What do I do to fix it and give her the love she so truly deserves? **TL;DR** My girlfriend is amazing but I don't get any happiness from her. Why?
Hi there, first time posting here so using a throwaway. My girlfriend and I have been dating since last February. We moved in together a few months ago and ever since, things have been slightly going downhill. Little things here and there are bugging each of us, and we seem to be out of sync completely. Our work schedules, moods, even our sleep schedules are just off. Sex, as well, has basically ended completely or happens rarely. I think I want to break up with her. I find myself more often than not wondering what it'd be like to live on my own again, I'm finding it tough to be as attracted to her as I used to, and I know that it can't always be good, but I'm struggling to find any good parts lately. I really do believe I've tried to fix some of the problems and I'm met with either a wall on her side, or complaints. The problem is, this will be a complete surprise to her, and she suffers from bad depression and very bad anxiety. I'm worried how she will take this/what will happen. I am quite positive she is still very much in love with me, even if I am no longer with her, as harsh as it sounds. I really don't want to hurt her but I'm really stuck here. Just looking for some advice, as this is my first serious relationship and one that, if possible, I'd like to end amicably. Just don't know how. If you read this far, thanks! Any advice would be appreciated. **TLDR** : Want to break up with girlfriend, but we live together. She has depression. What to do?
She just turned 40. Had been married less than a year. Aggressive breast cancer. Fought hard. We thought we’d have a few more months but she went downhill so fast and she died this weekend. I can’t function right. Having such a hard time. I was off work last week Thur and Fri for other reasons and then took yesterday off for this. I’m panicking because I’m supposed to work today. I’m work from home and still don’t feel like I can do it. She was so amazing. She was my touchstone. I am estranged from my family and she and my husband were my real family. I feel so lost without her. I can’t stop crying. She loved me so much and made me feel seen AND also loved. Unlike my blood family who could never even see me much less love me. I don’t know what to do without her
Last Christmas Day, my family suffered two deaths. My Father in Law died of Covid after a particularly long Illness and if that wasn’t enough, a close friend of the family died suddenly of a heart attack….all on Christmas morning. We’re having the family to our house on Christmas Day and we have people of all ages, some who (rightly) want to celebrate the day, whilst others are (equally rightly) not looking forward to it. I want to find a way of acknowledging the anniversary but equally treating it as a cause of celebration….can anyone offer some guidance / advice? Thank you.
This is my first attempt posting here, but likely won't be my last. My wife died almost a month ago, and there's one particular thing that I'm struggling with above all else. Just recognizing that she's gone. We were the type of people who were in contact constantly throughout the day, whether it be in person, on the phone, or through texting. We were always talking about whatever was going on throughout the day. She was basically my best friend on top of being my wife. I'm sure this is a common problem for people so intertwined, but my issue is that I just keep seeing things I would want to tell her about, memes she would love, new games coming out that she would want to play. After 20 years together my brain instantly sees these things and goes "Oh we should text wife!", and the realization hits again and again. I mean, I was there when she took her last breath and have her ashes in a moving box as we speak, so there's no illusions that she's not gone. It's just this constant struggle to accept it, or maybe just realizing it over and over. So I guess I'm hoping to hear from someone else that's been through something similar. Do these kinds of thoughts fade or get less frequent over time?
Right now I'm curled up with my SO, who is fast asleep. I slept for a couple broken hours, but it wasn't restful. I would like to sleep, but I'm not good at waking up when I need to. I have a curfew of sorts (they don't tell me when to be home, but get mad when I stay out late... I've taken to telling them when I'll be back... But if I miss that time for any reason they get angry again) and need to get back home in about an hour and a half. In theory, I should be able to nap but I can't even though I'm tired because I'd have to wake up and I don't know that I can. I've obviously tried alarms, but they don't work with real consistency... Idk, I'll sleep when I get back but I'd rather sleep now. Does anybody else have this particular issue, or some variant there of?
Hey guys, Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this. I'm not very sure if this is the right subreddit for this. My ex girlfriend (2 years ago) told me today that she was diagnosed with stage four brain cancer. Before we dated, we were best friends for many years and broke up through a mutual understanding. It wasn't the best breakup, it was pretty rough, actually; but after a while we were able to become friends again, it just wasn't the same like it used to be, as expected. I've had a different girlfriend with who I recently celebrated two years of being together. Although my ex's surgeries and treatments have been somewhat promising, stage four brain cancer doesn't have a very long survival term. I feel like I just need some guidance on what to do/where to go from here. We're young (19), so it was really out of the blue. Also, my grandmother passed away this spring from stage four lung cancer, so I feel like everyone I know and have loved is dying. I have depression, and this kind of just feels like it makes things worse. I feel really down and need some guidance, I think. Thanks again to anyone who reads this. **TL;DR: Ex gf of mine has been diagnosed with stage four brain cancer and I need guidance with what I can/should do, and how to help me cope with and understand this.**
throwaway because my SO knows my reddit username, dangit. SO and I have been married 4 years. We got together when I was young, immature and barely 20. He is patient, kind, loving, and really stuck with me through hard times, a lot of growing up and now we both feel proud of the progress we've made together as a couple. However, within the past 2 years or so, I can't shake this feeling that I'm missing out on something. I'm missing out on a solo life. I have never been on my own--just myself. I've been with him most of my adult life. I can't help but feel like I'd like to have my own apartment in the city, with my cat, a few belongings, and only worry about myself. Its a feeling that comes and goes, and really at the end of the day, I love him more than anything and realize life would be pretty bland without him. I've had this feeling a lot though and am scared if I don't act on it, I may regret it forever. This may sound like I'm being immature and not dealing with issues in marriage or whatever. That is not the case. We get along really well and our marriage is as good as it can be, not perfect, but what marriage is perfect. We are close with family and genuinely have a good time together. There's just this nagging feeling. Has anyone felt similar before? I have sort of brought it up in the past, and it understandably hurts his feelings and I'm sure I do a crap job explaining myself. TLDR: want to be alone, but can't leave my SO
I’m officially on 2 weeks mandatory work leave at home with a fever. And the flashbacks are real. He was just only sick too. I brought home his antibiotics and he was supposed to get better. But no. I found him dead in our kitchen instead while our son was alone in his crib for who knows how long. Every time I get sick or the boy gets sick I’m in a perpetual state of low level panic. And with this virus going around low level turns to mid level. And then with each cough or rise in temperature it turns to high level. It’s been 9 months. I feel like I’m starting to lose myself again.
At almost every concert, however, no matter how irritating, there was one piece - sometimes only a passage - that made you feel you'd done the right thing in coming here; that someone else (the composer) had understood, had known, your grief, that life was worth living because of music. At the same time, this music, or piece of music, also made it clear that you had been fooling yourself in attempting to go on with your life; that what had happened to the person you loved you would never get over; that you still carried it with you; that it lay beneath all things; and only this music - these few notes - recognized that everything else you had been doing, and would do, to fill up the time was meaningless.
In the past few years, I have had three failed relationships. One ended after we invested four years together, the second was several months, and the most recent ended after six months. Each of these relationships ended because the men (or boys, if you will) were not ready to commit. The worst part is that each of these men still wants me in their life, because they "still care" about me. It's impossible to not get discouraged by this; I'm not exaggerating when I say that all my friends are married. I find myself wondering what is it about me that makes these men not want to invest their time and love in me. I've made a conscious effort to not be clingy or expect too much too soon. I'm a teacher, have a good head on my shoulders, I'm not offensive to look at, and I know I have a lot of love to give. How do I stop myself from thinking I'm going to be forever alone? --- **tl;dr**: Am I not worth committing to?
Darkness, science says it does not exist for it is simply the absence of light. However darkness can be seen. Creeping at the edges of my eyes when I look into the mirror. It can be felt; seeping into my soul. Crawling out of the recesses of my mind where I struggle to keep it contained. Occasionally I see it bursting through in my actions, I hear it in my words. It’s angry claws making my throat hoarse. I feel as if it needs to be drowned out, suffocated, exfoliated, but everything I do seems to add to its fuel. See it starts with a pulse in my brain. Manageable at first, suppressible. However the more I suppress it, the more I push it down, the more it condenses, the more it solidifies. Eventually it’s simply a frothing dark mass in my brain, boiling over, destroying everything I’ve worked so hard to create. Right now I’m at a crossroad in my life, let it out and bury those around me? Or continue to stand in its way and hope it doesn’t destroy me. Pray I’m not lost in the cloud. KIP
Some people say the dumbest things and I know people have the right to their own opinion, but some of them are dumb and in some cases extremist points of views. Most of the time, I just ignore it, but I do fantasize about punching that person in the face, but never act on it because I'm aware of the consequences of it and know it's not worth it. I won't bring this up with my therapist because I'm afraid he might report what I said to the police. (As I brought up my child abuse), so there's no getting help from him. I just have a few annoying coworkers that I kinda wish I didn't have to co-exist with. I don't hate them. I just imagine them saying or doing something dumb and me overreacting by punching them, but it never happens. Sometimes when I'm home, I punch my pillow up. I know I'm stuck in my head alot.
My friend's turning 29, and as every year I dread her upcoming bday party. Obviously, I'm cool with her but I don't really get along with her friends. I have tried to be friendly with them but they are not interested, which I respect. I always end up being bored for 3 hours+ and fake laughing in a lousy restaurant with 15 other people I don't really like. Ive done that every year for the past 10 years but this year,my introvert self really wants a pass! Is it rude if I let her know that I won't be attending but that I will plan something special just for her during the upcoming week? I was thinking of taking her to watch a play or a concert and then going to a bar (I will pay for the expenses). Do you think she will be offended? TL;DR : Is it rude not to attend a friend's bday party, just once? Update: I ended up not going. I will take her out next week to make up for it. thanks for all the replies :)
I don't know where to start. For whatever reason I started getting bad panic attacks in high school senior year. I would just get up and leave class. I went to college, I did very well, but then for whatever reason I started getting anxiety again. I started leaving classes, and dropped out. I'm back in college again, doing very well again, but today I couldn't sit in class any longer and I just stood up and left. It's probably been like 7 years since I started having this problem. There are only like 6 people in the class. We had a professor and a guest speaker. I was only there for like 25 minutes out of a 2 and a half hour lecture. I just got up and walked out. The first professor I ever did this to, years ago, was always very mad about it. I have trouble in crowds too. Like in New York subways and long lines. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm just going to end up homeless because I'll never be able to hold down a job where I've got to do anything that involves sitting and being quiet.
There was a girl I loved since we met when I was fifteen and she was sixteen. Two years ago after 35 years of friendship we had an argument and she blocked me from her life. I know I said the wrong thing, I was hurting and not thinking. What I said was not unforgivable. I never claimed to be a perfect friend but I loved her like a sister, maybe my love for her was too much or she felt it was too little, maybe we really just grew apart and it was only going to take one argument to stop our friendship. I can look back now and see how hard it was to keep her happy and how I had to work to keep our friendship going, maybe she felt that way too. I knew it was really over when my dad died six weeks ago and she sent a condolence message to my son yet couldn’t even send a card to my mum and definitely didn’t bother to contact me. Yet I’m still sad and still I miss her. Maybe sharing this will help, maybe not.
Hey all, my anxiety has gotten worse recently. While it's not awful, it limits me here and there from approaching certain situations. My psychiatrist wants me to go on Cipralex and I'm extremely hesitant, despite the fact that mindfulness exercises and deep breathing doesn't help me very much anymore at this point, and taking Clonazepam makes me way too drowsy. As much as I'm worried about side effects, I'm most thrown off by the fact I can't drink while on it. The main reason I'm thinking of medicating myself is because I'm supposed to travel the world for the next year (I'm trying to step way outside my comfort zone) and I'm extremely anxious for it. Not being able to drink while I do this is really getting me down, because I feel like it's a great lubricant to meet new people and be more comfortable around them. I, by no means, am a frequent drinker, but I feel like I would while in hostels and the like. Are there any solutions to this? Any other meds I could take that would make this better? I do doubt my ability to effectively travel with my anxiety as it is right now, but I'm trying to explore my options I guess.
I have always been an angry person. I feel it in my chest all the time but usually I smile through it. I'm the guy that always is the target from someone who wants to start a fight. I was taught to never fight. It just always happens to me and sucks when people see me not do anything at all. I reacted one time and then scared everyone and people wouldn't even want to talk to me... Also, my anger comes out in words that hit people right in the soul. Especially when people are overly happy. I think so hard on everything. I never know when people are joking or not. How does one become happy?
One of my friends sent me a photo from when we were younger to bring up a funny memory. The photo was during a period in which I was struggling with restrictive eating a lot. The context of the photo had nothing to do with my weight at all. However, I couldn’t stop looking at myself and thinking “I wish I was that skinny again” I have been pretty good with restrictive eating this year. The longest I’ve gone without eating in 2018 is 36 hours (which is pretty good for me). But seeing that photo has got me super anxious about the way that I look and I’m actually beginning to panic a little. I’m scared to leave the house because I’m afraid of having strangers stare at my body. I’ve tried some mindfulness exercises (leaves on a stream & 5-4-3-2-1) to slow down my thoughts, but they aren’t working at the moment. I’m scared of falling too far into obsessive thoughts, and if anybody has any tips or advice that could help me get back to the present moment, I would really appreciate it. I have been trying my best to avoid purging and I am willing to try anything that could help.
So, I have panic disorder, GAD, OCD, and MDD. I just got off a medical leave from work on April 1 and have made it to work every single shift. I’m a nurse and our shifts are 12 hours long but I’m usually there 14 hours by the time I give report finish up. So, my days are really long. Well, long story short, the stress of being a new nurse and the stress of the physical exhaustion led me to a complete breakdown in December. This a 4 month medical leave. When I came back, I talked to my manager about my schedule. I legitimately cannot work more than 3-4 shifts in a 7 day period. Any more than that then the panic attacks and agoraphobia get so bad I become non-functional. So, last week I got my schedule for this week. They have scheduled me to work 6 out of the next 7 days. There is no way I can do this. That’s experience talking, not negative thinking. The last time they scheduled me like that, I had to go on leave for 4 months. I asked my boss about it (I have a doctors note that “recommends” I not work more than 3 shifts in a 7 day period— which is still considered full time by hospital policy) and basically she said that since my doctor only “recommended” it they don’t HAVE to do it. So, I either work it or lose my job. I’m a single mother. So, if I lose my job, I lose my home and the financial ability to support my son. So, I have no choice but to try to get through the next 7 days. I’m terrified. Any encouragement would be welcomed. Thanks for listening.
I once lived in a place....A place I was able to see the girl I crushed on. I liked this girl for a very long time, I confessed to her in a way I wasn't supposed to. She didn't reject me though she told me she was shy and turned away because nobody has ever confessed to her. I don't know how true that is. However, I moved away because of family. A series of events occurred. During these events she liked me when I didn't. I liked her later on when she didn't. We talked things through eventually but she's always on my mind and I know she doesn't like me but I legit want to marry this girl and it depresses me cuz I don't know how long it's gonna take for me to figure my shit out. I can't tell her to wait for me that would be too weird. I don't want to confess again cuz I feel like it would destroy our friendship and I wouldn't want to lose what we have. Any suggestions? I'm willing to do anything. (We talk almost everyday through WhatsApp)
One night ,when my mom was pregnant with me, she woke up in blood,she screamed and called an ambulance Something fell from there and should have only stayed in bed The thing got back but was unstayble O month later she went to a profesional doctor who didn't analyze correctly me and said i will die after birth but after another analize again they found out that i have a syndrome called Eugene that was confirmed by the blue circles on my head A normal baby had three which means it was fine but i had five The doctor should have taken something to analyze it After two weeks they haven't found out anything My mom went to the doctor and a miracle happend I was completly healthy God showed mercy I have a youtube MultiWarrior Twitter WarriorMulti
So I like this one girl and I plan to ask her after spring break. However, should I? I mean, I feel l Ike we should get to know each other more. I want to ask her out and get it over with but I feel like a bit more time should be used. Also, how do I guarantee that I don’t come off as just another friend? And a bit off topic, but my friends have been telling me to add her on like Facebook and stuff. Thing is, I sent a friend request to her and she hasn’t accepted or declined it. So...is this a bad/terrible/you’re shut out of luck sign? Tl;dr- How do I ask her out? Should I? Also, she hasn’t responded to a friend request that I sent. Is it a bad sign?
I(24F)dating with my bf(25M) for two months then he got home for a while and told his parents abt me. Then they disapproved our relationship bcz I’m not Christian and they belived that would causes diffierent ways of raising kids and tons of effects Bcz we are having different religions.BUT THIS IS NOT HAPPENING SO FAR . And I’m not a very religious person who is also very open minded. they never see me but already disapprove me And their son is getting so well with me! My bf was very worried so he asked me if we should be friends instead, it’s a discussion but it broke my heart! We decided to ignore them so far and keep in relationship. But! (1)I feel humilaited bcz they never seen me and they don’t care my value and put a label on me. (2) What makes me more stressed and upset was my bf was really swayed and asked if we should breakup....I feel like I need to pull him back to me by giving him confidence ..while I’m the one who’s the most stressed.. even though ofc he decide not to get swayed so far. But that gesture already hurt me. I don’t know what I have to do...with my emotion.... and this situation. I’m just wondering if I’ll get too stressed that it will lead to breakup but really , this man is amazing. But I really don’t want to feel like making so much effort for his parents to like me, while worrying if he get swayed or not. Thanku for advice :) TL;DR relationship with different religion person and his parents and his reaction frustrated me, influence my emotion.
We started dating my sophomore year of college and she is my first real relationship and the girl I lost my virginity to. She is incredibly sweet, caring and very supportive and I feel that she is more invested in our relationship than I am. I have told her that I love her and I mean it, however I catch myself checking out other women and fantasizing about being single or in another relationship. There are also moments when I picture the two of us in about 10 years, married with kids and totally happy together. I’m not sure if that is normal or a red flag that needs to be addressed/how to address it. We have been living together for about 2 years now and have signed a lease to live together for another year. Not sure what to do here. **TL;DR;** fantasize about being single as well as being married to girlfriend in the future. Not sure if I need to breakup.
Sometimes I don't feel good enough at anything. I can't hold down a job to save my life because my anxiety gets the better of me, I'm not that great of a cook so unless it's seafood it tastes like shit, and I'm even doubting myself as an artist....it just seems like whenever I'm really proud of something, I always hear something negative no matter what....am I even an artist at this point? No one commissions me, I still can't even get a decent following on any art or social website, I still live with my folks and I'm almost 23 with nothing achieved.........People always say "Do better! Push harder! Keep going!" but at what cost? I AM trying. I AM pushing harder...but no matter how far I push, I feel like I'm just in the same spot no matter what.....I hate this....
i have… had… 2 dogs, both males. They marked their territory everywhere, so i took them to my aunt bc she has lots of dogs and she took them to surgery. well, one of them didn’t make it. i feel so bad. he had been with me for most of my life, through my worst moments. i miss him so much. i can feel absence in my home. i try to act strong, but every night i cry. i don’t wanna tell my friends. i told my other aunt and she said something that made me feel bad. i miss him. i wish i had a time machine. i suffer from anxiety and depression and a little bit of agoraphobia and for many years i have been better. i don’t wanna leave my house. i miss my dog so so so much. i can feel still here. i miss his warmth.
It started for me when I was 16. I broke my hand twice by punching walls. Years passed, I have seen psychiatrist, hypnosis, did combat sports, I'm taking pills to chill since 2 years. And same again I burn of rage for different reasons. Now I'm 40, I'm married and I have two young children, a girl of 6 months and a boy of 2 years. I had again today a argument with my wife and as usual I started to turn red psycho, I'm used of that. But what trauma will have my babies? I have to move alone because I'll create more issues for my lovely than being an example. During years I thought I was possessed by some kind of evil. Now I know I'm like that and the only thing I have to do is to avoid people as much as I can. I'm just like that.
About an hour ago I've just had my worst anxiety attacks it started with a gut feeling that something was wrong then all of the sudden I've rushed into a worried panic state I was shaking very very bad my heart rate had went up 20 more beats a minute than usual I tried to take a nap but I couldnt I felt helpless and fear over nothing I didn't know what to do about 30 minutes in it randomly passed I still have an odd gut feeling is this something else or just a very bad panic attack Thank You.
everyone hates me First it was middle school, where I let the person who I thought was my best friend walk all over me and then abandon me, and left me all alone. Next, it was in high school, where I was left alone by a person who I also thought was a close friend of mine, saying she felt "unappreciated", while she was the one who didn't respect me at all. It doesn't help that at home I have a horrible sister who does everything to hurt me, and parents who say they'll listen to me and my problems, but really won't. I just wish I knew why everyone always ends up leaving me, all alone. Im left to my horrible thoughts, which just make me want to do some horrible things. First was cutting my hair, then it was cutting more of my hair, and then it was some urges to take some pills everyday, that weren't really mine. (I didn't take any because I couldn't find any). I try to distract myself with stuff I may like to do and things that "interest me", but I've just slowly realized that nothing interests me anymore, and all I want to do anymore is just stay in bed and sleep. I'm really sorry for this rant, but I just couldn't stop myself, I just needed to distract myself before I did something I would regret later. My mental status has just disintegrated so fast over the past 5 years, and I always act like I'm okay and happy because I just have to. Just so no one has to worry about me in the end. Im sorry
Those were couples things. I haven't been able to sit through a TV show or movie since losing my wife. That's not 100% accurate. From time to time, something is compelling enough for me to commit to. But it's still difficult. Four years after losing my wife, I'm in a relationship with a woman I want to marry. She's not a widow, but she's been hurt more than anyone I've ever known (and I had a career in social services). We've never watched a movie together, but we had to have a conversation about how we're going to manage that. This is not a reality I ever expected. She's at the point where she will only watch movies that she's seen before. If they throw in some unexpected emotional stuff one or both of us will fall to pieces. I remember choosing a movie for me and my wife, not long after we learned that she had a terminal illness. I wanted something light and fun, to take our minds off of our troubles. I chose Disney's *Up.* I had no idea what a huge mistake that would turn out to be.
I had this one thing I was anxious about for a while. Due to some major life events it didn’t exactly resolve itself, but I stopped caring about that thing. I don’t know if everyone with anxiety experiences this or not but I get into thought spirals of snowballing catastrophic thoughts. It will start out with a small issue and I will eventually dig myself into a pit where the only possible outcome of this issue is everyone hates me/Im wasting my life/I am the worst possible human in existence/eternal misery. It’s crippling and horrible and I hope it’s not as common as anxiety itself for other people’s sake because it does really ruin your fucking night. Anyway so I guess what I want to say is that I feel like while one problem of mine FINALLY stopped causing these spirals, I don’t actually feel better. I think my brain has just found other ways to make up for it by reframing the problem into a way that makes me care about it again. So instead of “yay, X no longer bothers me!” My brain says “okay cool but have you considered why X no longer bothers you? Do you think maybe it’s fucked up that you don’t care anymore? Don’t you think it’s a sign that you’re a messed up person and that youre dooming yourself to a life of pain and loneliness if you just shut off your cares like that?” One second I can step back and realize maybe it’s not rational to feel this way, but there’s always the doubt, maybe I really DONT have anxiety and maybe i am a messed up person? Sorry I’m going through this right now and just needed to vent to myself
So I’m a 26 year old female and I’ve never had a proper relationship which is so rare I instantly feel like a loser when I have to tell people. It’s so shit because I know people must be thinking there must be something wrong with me and I end up wondering that too tbh. Unless I’m completely deluded idk I’m not ugly, I do get some attention from guys but it’s hardly ever from anyone I’m interested in and Im not into one night stands. I used to be very shy and anxious so I understand why I never had a bf when I was younger but in the past few years I don’t know why it’s never happened. There are so many guys out there but when you filter out all the ones in a relationship, aren’t near my age, aren’t straight, have nothing in common with, aren’t decent looking and aren’t into me there really aren’t many left. Usually I just get on with life but tonight I just feel so sad about it. I want to meet that person I click with and feel safe with and can laugh with and support each other and hold at night. And not only have I never in my 26 years had that, I have this horrible feeling I might never get it. Is anyone else in this situation? Does anyone have any words of encouragement I feel so unlovable and alone tonight
me and my girlfriend got together in the middle of january. i love her more than ive ever loved anyone. we're both seniors in high school, and she's going to colorado state in august. im staying here in illinois. 14 hours from her. every. single. fucking. time. anyone ever mentions anything about college that's immediately what my mind goes to. and i get super fucking anxious. i feel this excruciating pain in my stomach and this just fucking sucks. she's so excited about it and i want to be excited for her but i just can't and i fucking hate it. all her siblings are in long distance relationships and my therapist told me she spent time with her husband away from him and it was the best thing to ever happen to their marriage. but i can't help but believe that it's just not going to work. ive been hurt really bad before in the past and i just assume the worst now out of anything and it fucking sucks and i wish i could just believe that this is going to work out and everythings going to be fine but i fucking can't and it's stressful and FUCK. i feel sick. thank you for listening to my rant.
My GF it's in she's hometown for vacation 3 months and she's staying one more, when she's gone I feel lonely I stay in bed and don't do anything else than eat and go to the bathroom I don't clean myself or anything I think it's because the huge anxiety that being apart from her causes me. Since then I've been so depressed even though she tells me she loves me I feel that deep wish of killing myself and I feel like a disaster. Maybe you'll say I should do something but I don't know how to start (no friends, no family, I don't talk or interact with anyone that it's not her ) I haven't get out of my house but to buy food since then and the last time I went out without her was like 2 years ago. I feel so lonely and useless. Yesterday I felt so bad that didn't even looked at my phone, was that suicidal and anxiety feeling. She got mad at me by not answering and told me to leave her alone, I feel worse so anxious that I can't even talk or stop crying, I feel that I really want to kill myself, I can't imagine living without her it's the only human interaction I have,dunno what to do. Also I've lost like 14 kg by how I am living. Thanks for listening I just needed to talk to someone or just write it.
I met this girl and we started casually dating, she propositioned polyamory because I was still dating around she was still confused with this previous guy and she thought I wouldn't settle for her. She then travels overseas for 6 months and I've only known her for 4 months. While she's gone she falls in love with another guy (M22?). She comes back and eventually we start sleeping together while technically she's still in a relationship with this guy from overseas. She falls back in love with me, but this guy from overseas is coming to visit her, my now girlfriend, at least what she EMOTIONALLY agrees she is. To be with her for a week at a holiday-type of place. I want her to be with me but she says she's made her mind to see him. Even though she knows she loves me she doesn't want to hurt this guy. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth for our future potential relationship. What do I do? --- **TL;DR**: Girl I was seeing who was semi-in-love with me travels and falls in love with another guy. She comes back and falls in love with me again. BUT the guy is still coming here to see her. What do I do?
With negative things in life, my reaction was usually depression or sadness and seldom ever anger. I've noticed a trend over the past year that the same things now result more often in anger. And my anger is less controlled where I turn crazy and cannot see things clearly at all. I get so angry I want to quit my job, stop talking to anyone and run away. The concerning part is how crazy I become when angry and that it completely ruins my entire day. The other day I ripped my hair out and punched a concrete floor. This is so not like me at all and it kind of scares me. Why might this be happening and what can I do? Thank you. Edit: If it matters, I am male age 21. Only changes in life have been finishing school and worked my first year in a serious full time job. Live alone with no family unless I fly to see them. Loneliness is an issue
I misunderstood how serious of a step it is moving in with your SO. I found out that as good as we are together, we are still learning a great deal about each other and ourselves still. We live in a small space and have highly interconnected lives.. Living together when so much is still uncertain makes things super, super, super confusing.... Based on everything I have experienced so far I have realized that right now, I am not comfortable committing my whole life to our relationship; tthat isn't to say I haven't thought about it at different points. However, I just haven't discovered everything I need to feel safe about a long-term future together (getting married etc..) and I don't think I will find that answer living together... I know I love her, I just misgauged when I would be ready for this step in our relationship.. All I want to know is if anyone has been in this position, and how they handled bringing this conversation up with their SO. This conversation is happening. it has to. I am hoping you guys can help me find a way to be eloquent and lighthearted. Also, maybe provide some anecdotal experience about how this effected your relationship. --- **tl;dr**: We moved in too soon. I love her. I just don't think I am finding the answers I need for our long term compatibility living under the same roof. I want to know if other have experienced this and if they found providing more space in their relationship gave them clarity.. Thanks
I was looking for a charger in my fiancé's drawers when I stumbled on a pair of pink satin panties. They are 100% not mine. We own our own washer and dryer. I do all the laundry so I would have noticed if this was in the mix earlier. Also, the size is much smaller than what I would estimate our most recent women house guests would wear. I'm waiting for him to get home and respond to my messages now. How fucked is this relationship? Is there anything else this can be? **TL;DR Is there any scenario where I'm not being cheated on?**
I never thought I have to be here saying this about my dad but he is suffering from alcoholism. He has been in the hospital several times and just got out of rehab again this last week. The doctor has told him if he drinks again and ends back in the hospital..he would pass away. I remember growing up seeing the trash cans filled all the way to the top with beer cans and etc.. and it just makes me cringe at the thought of his insides are just... I'm sorry this is hard for me. His body is deteriorating. My dad has became verbally abusive and letting the world's negative energy consume him. He would say things to me I never heard him say before and I don't know why but I couldn't help but to be hurt but my mom is explaining to me his brain is off etc and I don't think that's a total but that doesn't give you the right to be disrespectful. Anyways, I told my mom the incidents where he spoke to me this way and wants to have a chat about the behavior. Yet, I know he is on his way out and minupulating her to stay to take care of him !!! I'm so fucking done with life that I just don't have time to deal withy father passing from something like this!!! I don't want to come home to a dead body. I don't want it to be my father and it is ripping into shreads. (Mentally) What do I do ...what do I do..
Hi, throwaway account just in case. I’m partway through grad school, and I’ve had pretty bad anxiety all my life. I can pinpoint instances in elementary school when I was affected by it, so it’s nothing new or situational. For the past few months especially, I’ve just felt absolutely drained from it. Even when I’m simply sitting watching tv my body just feels physically nervous, I never feel settled. I definitely isolate myself a bit and don’t reach out to friends as much as I should. I can’t force myself to raise my hand and speak in class for the life of me. The thought of starting assignments gives me anxiety so I tend to delay that a bit (but nothing too last minute, I always get things done). I have panic attacks maybe once every few months, so at least they’re not too frequent. Lately I’ve just been feeling like I can’t keep this up anymore, and am coming to the realization that medication might be able to help me. But I’m way too nervous to take first steps. And even if I managed to research & make an appointment somewhere, I think I’d shut down and have too much anxiety to talk (I often can’t even express things to my boyfriend when I’m especially anxious and we’re talking on the phone, and have to text him later to apologize and explain what was going on). The only way I think I could *possibly* handle it is if my boyfriend were to go with me, but unfortunately we’re in a long-distance relationship right now so it’s not exactly feasible. I just feel very stuck. I don’t know what to do anymore, and would appreciate any input. I’m so exhausted of feeling perpetually nervous, this shouldn’t be normal.
So, two months ago I (27) broke up with my bf (29) after 5 years because of the way he treated me. He wasn't abusive or something like that. It just that I wasn't his priority and I didn't feel reassured or loved by him. Which made me feel so bad with myself to the point I hurt myself. At some point I decided, even though I loved him, I needed to end things and try to be happy by myself and be alone for some time. That's what I am trying to do now. So, after meeting with him due to the 'end-things-properly-conversation', he has realized all the 'bad things' he did to me and 'learned his lesson'. He didn't want to to come back with me, he just apologized to me. That made feel terrible. So now we've broken up he has opened his eyes and changed. I feel that now, he would be more like the person I needed him to be. And it's over. There is no chance for us to come back. He's going to be that person with another girl. And that thought is killing me. It's so unfair. I feel I was his guinea pig for future relationships. I need some insights of this. Tl;Dr I broke up with my bf because he didn't treat me properly. Now he has changed and has become the person I needed him to be. I feel terrible.
I'm a little psychotic and off my medication again and I need to admit myself to a hospital, so I can take my meds and let them take full effect in a safe place. what should I know and how do I go about doing this. i live in California but have no insurance here. moved from oregon. still have insurance in oregon. do I have to travel back there to get care or should I Go to a hospital here? backstory: have a job, have a little money saved. hate my coworkers. no official address. staying in airbnb while saving for an apartment. really want to walk away from all this and based on the way my coworkers and family respond to me lately I think my mental health is far gone. I feel parts of my personality hardening to cope with this and it freaks me out. I think a lot about violence.
6 years ago I adopted an 11 year old cat named Esther. She was the sweetest, most beautiful little fluff ever. I wasn’t a cat person at all before that, and she has changed my heart forever. We had to take her for her final vet visit two days ago. Yesterday picked up her ashes. Everything just feels so empty. She had kidney disease and thyroid disease and so much of the daily routine centered around her. My girlfriend and I didn’t stay overnight anywhere hardly at all because we didn’t want to leave her and when we did we got a friend to come over and give her her medicine. Not giving her her medicine in the morning or cleaning her ears or feeding her that nasty smelling kidney diet wet food or letting her out on the back porch so she can lay on the sun or pulling up blinds leaving the house and seeing her wait on us when we got back or meow when we open the door because she was sitting right in front of it....... it sucks. I’ve wanted to leave the house so bad but it’s been such a struggle. I’m finally out having a burger and a much needed beer. I just don’t know how to be without my Esther. That cat was my life and helped me through so much hard stuff.
My girlfriend for some reason has no qualms about making plans without me and executing said plans. Is it just me, or is it normal that when two people in a serious relationship are both interested in doing something, that they are both each others #1 priority and do that activity together no matter what? For example, my girlfriend and I were both excited about the new black panther film coming up, we were both giddy and talking about it on the phone or what not. Although it turns out that while she was over at my house she went online and bought a ticket for black panther without me knowing, she even had the nerve to ask me "are you going to go see the movie?" although she phrased it as though to ask if I was going to go see it by myself or with another friend. Which is just bizarre to me? Isn't it customary in a relationship that couples go see a movie that they really want to see *together* without much question on the matter? In a relationship, I'm used to me and my partner doing most things we enjoy together, like watching movies, watching a tv show, playing games, etc... but it seems she's all too eager to go off and do things without me and it has me concerned that I'm not much of a priority. I even told her this upset me but she went off to go watch black panther anyway on a day that I worked instead of waiting the next day so we could go together. --- **tl;dr**: GF has no qualms about making plans without me. Doesn't seem interested in effectuating most plans and activities as a couple.
He was supposed to get out of the hospital but instead he died. Now we have to come up with a bunch of money for the cremation and services, and we can't even afford rent. My daddy was the best man I knew. If I had a problem I could tell him and he'd always fix it. We told eachother lame jokes, we liked the same music. And now he's gone and I have no one to talk to. Every little thing makes me cry. His truck, his sandals, his shirts, his bag. I kept his phone, and it gets messages from facebook. Every time I hear his ringtone I cry. It's not fair.
How the fuck did I end up paying $100 a month for a parking spot that other people try to park in every single week? Probably because the fucking building doesn't even *try* to communicate with new residents about the parking situation and it says in the lease we all get a spot so everyone just assumed they can pick whichever one they fucking want not understanding that their "complimentary parking" consists of the 5 STREET SPOTS THAT ARE FILLED EVERY MORNING BY STAFF MEMBERS. I love my room. I love that I get to call this my home. But FOR FUCKS SAKE. The building is 137 fucking years old, no air conditioning. You're not told that until you're walking through for the first time of course. They have to fix the boiler every week which means the hot water will randomly shut off all the fucking time. Hike up your water bill keeping the faucets on all the time or they'll fucking freeze and explode. Management is fucking useless. They've lose 4/5 packages and pieces of mail I've had sent here. They lost my ballot. Never gave me a laundry key. Never actually informed me where the laundry room was until I left a review about the poor communication. 1200 a month for a fucking month for this shit show. And I'm *still* in poverty. I *still* don't have enough money to pay tuition and feed myself. Got a letter the other day asking if I want to renew my lease for 6 extra months ($10 off rent every month if I do!) like I'm sorry are you *fucking kidding me*? It beats living with my parents and it beats being homeless but holy hell is it misery.
So a few months ago, a long time friend of mine, who has moved away and has been long distance for several years now, told me that they were intentionally letting our friendship deteriorate to see if I was worth keeping around. They've basically erased me from their existence. It's been 7 months since then. I've made my peace. Or so I thought. My high school is having an Alumni marching band night that I'm going to, so I was looking through some old photos from high school for it. There were just.... So many.... With them in it. So many happy memories that bring me so much pain now. A smile I'll likely never get to see, let alone create, ever again. I thought I was over this. I thought I'd moved on. But it still hurts so bad. I've tried replacing the.... Sadness, abandonment, rejection, with..... Indifference, distance, anger even at times. But it still hurts. So bad. Nothing erases the pain. I know this isn't really anxiety related, per say, but bringing up all of these old memories is making me anxious in general, and I just... Needed to talk about it.
I'm so sick of hearing/reading about people saying they have anxiety, when they've never even been diagnosed (meaning they've never even brought it up to their dr) or they don't even take any action to make a difference for themself. I never just assume this..but it's typically the info I get, when I ask how they cope with their anxiety. Most common reply I get is "haha I don't (cope)". It's frustrating because it's not funny to me. My anxiety attacks literally make me throw up and not able to breathe. I also get severe migraines. I have to take a pill, medical marijuana and go to therapy (all of which isn't cheap). It can be so debilitating at times, when it gets bad. It's frustrating when it's a real issue and too many people wrongly overuse the term or make jokes. Ok, I'm done venting. Just curious if anyone else felt the same, different or indifferent on the topic. I'm sorry for sounding insensitive. I'm just upset and also I can't sleep as usual.
Anytime i’m feeling down (which is like 95% of my existence, i’m depressed &amp; anxious) my family or anyone’s really, tries to help me. I’m usually always crying, which is embarrassing enough. But people say things like: “sometimes it’s good to get out of your head and do something.” “what can i do to help?” “i’m here if you need me.” “why don’t we take a walk?” “what if you change your perspective?” and my response to things like this is always (mostly bc i’m in that crying anxious frustrated state that is totally not my true self): “please stop you’re not helping.” “it’s not that easy!” “you don’t get it!” “this is making me feel worse!” i don’t know why the anger comes out when given advice... it’s really frustrating to me because it’s like not even my true self responding. it’s like i’m so frustrated for feeling down all the time and want it to end that it’s like i don’t even want the help. i don’t i feel really messed up mentally. oh and don’t you worry, i feel all the shame &amp; guilt from acting that way minutes or hours after. so i still don’t understand why i let myself get to that point.
I've been on Klonopin for over a year straight, taking 2 0.5mg tablets a day. My psychiatrist recently had me start decreasing my dosage from 2 a day -> 1 & 1/2 a day -> 1 a day -> 1/2 a day, over the past 2 months. Surprisingly, I haven't really had any withdrawal symptoms despite the, what I believe to be, a short period of time to decrease considering how much I've been on. Just to note, I've never abused it over the course of the year - or ever. Anyway, I was on 1/2 for a month because I was afraid to take the next step which is stopping it completely. Well, I'm on day 3 of not taking it and I definitely feel a difference in my anxiety levels. I just don't know how to handle and deal with my anxiety now that I don't have Klonopin. I loved that drug and it helped me for over a year, never had any issues. I was prescribed it awhile back by a former psychiatrist who I stopped seeing because she didn't seem "professional" enough, and considering that she kept me on Klonopin for over a year, I still stand by that. I was just so used to having it and now that I don't have it I feel helpless and don't know what to do and how to handle it. I don't have anyone to talk to about this so I figured I'd try this sub again as it's helped me in the past. Sorry for the huge paragraph when all this could probably have been said much easier, my thoughts just tend to flow and I don't notice how much I type, thanks.
In mid January I found out I was pregnant. It was not planned. Although the first week I was in shock, we decided we really wanted the baby and we were both so excited, despite being in difficult circumstances we would make it work. First blood test- HCG is great. I’m nauseas and my boobs are stinging all week. Doctor wants to check my levels in 2 day’s because I’m spotting (really light brown very occasional). Overly cautious? We find out then that my levels are increasing but not doubling. I had 5 blood tests over a fortnight. Increasing but not doubling. I begin to hate my doctor and all the tests. I start to stress out- spend all my free time reading about HCG and people’s stories. I get so anxious about my blood tests- I don’t even want to go anymore. Yesterday was my last blood test. Today I started bleeding. Just like the start of a period- clots, red blood... I know the baby is gone. Ironically the doctor calls me today and says my hcg is still going up but not by enough. My partner, he doesn’t want to face it. He keeps saying he feels confident. Keeps talking about when the baby is born. Spends time talking to my stomach. He’s in denial. I’m bracing myself for the next week of loss. Such heart ache 💔
So, low job, low pay, low respect, high amount of work. Guess what, though I'm a student, wanna believe it or not, I HAVE TO GRIND MY ASS ON WORK EVERYDAY. So Sorry, you are nobody special. I would like to clarify that this post is not for the hard-working teachers and Administration who bear a lot of shit from their own administrations, who have to do lots of work, with very low pay and unhelpful attitudes from students and parents. I respect their efforts and wish that their conditions would better. This post is for the shitty douchebag teachers who pick on students when they have no reason to, my Physics teacher who couldn't justify his screaming at me, the shitty teachers who do not pick on students they should pick on and pick indiscriminately! If anyone of you is here on Reddit you may want to tell me to stop thinking myself someone deserving Special behaviour! Right! Agreed, my autism doesn't make me special! So what you want me to do? Choke on Weed till I die?
Hello. I am a college student and I have not made any friends, all high school friends go to different colleges so we barely have contact anymore and when we do conversations are mundane and feel like a chore that I rather not be talking to them. Here in college I am often overwhelmed with all my classes and work. I feel numb most of the time if not all the time. I usually feel like doing nothing, sometimes I just sleep instead of getting started on my school work. I don't feel like killing myself. I just don't want to be doing anything. I don't want to be alone, but I've gotten so use to being alone that it is the only lifestyle I know. I don't like partying, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I am a boring college student. I have not joined clubs because I spend most of my time sleeping and also I get behind on classes because of my mental state. I don't know what to do. I feel lost. I feel empty inside. There is so much I want to do in the future, but so little I want to do now. I just want to break down and cry, but I can't. My body physically won't let me. I feel everything inside, but at the same time I feel nothing.
I am 8 months a widow to a husband of 30 years and i'm having a few days where it feels like it happened yesterday, on top of a week and A HALF WHERE i WANTED TO DIE AGAIN THEN A FEW BETTER DAYS THEN THIS HELL ON EARTH AGAIN.If God\[if he exists\] said you can die now, it won't hurt anyone, I wouldn't hesitate! I'm on two types of antidepressants. I see a psychologist every few weeks.What is wrong with me?? I thought I would be nearly better by now.Someone tell me it well or I'll either go stark raving mad or I'll die despite my 17 year old son.I don't want to do this to him.please help somebody!!!!!!!
Mother's Day is coming up. We've gotten through some bad days before (Taylor's birthday was in October (would have been his 20th), the holidays, etc.) This will be another Bad Day I think. I want to do something for my wife, something that says "I love you and I'm thinking of Taylor" but I don't know what. Something that say's that she's still a mother. Just like she's still a daughter even though her parents have passed. I don't know what to do though. It seems like all we can do is go through the motions of life. Nothing matters, house is a mess, yard is a mess, we don't care about anything anymore. I don't know. Nothing matters to me except trying to take her pain away. I can't do that, and that's almost as much torture as watching Taylor die in the hospital.
a few months ago i lost my grandmother and my mom lost her mother on top of all the other fuckery we’re dealing with today. i was having a convo with my mom and she said “we’re going to get super tons of rain.” and i just said “super tons of rain?” like just poking fun at how she worded it, and she starts laughing to the point where (i’m not kidding) scared me a little. i’ve never seen her laugh like that at something so unfunny, and it makes me uneasy. does anyone have experience with living with unstable parents/family or grief in general?
Often burdened by all sorts of dark thoughts, I can’t really be happy. I wish I grow up from a different family, parents that are supportive and caring since I was born, who never abuse me. I wish I knew what’s the real reason of my high school friends who left me behind few years ago, aside from the official saying of “just drifted apart”. I often find myself crying about this whenever I had insomnia. I wish I can be like, purely happy and chatty, pouring out my heart and soul to people around me like I was never hurt. I wanted to be someone like that, but it’s so hard to open up and share. Tonight is just another night with wet pillow.
Where the fuck do I even start. It's been a month and 10 days since my supposed due date. Every day has just been a mental struggle then I finally broke down. Things barely ever go my way. I mean my life has been a crap pit from day one. Molested, kidnapped, homeless from age 6-9 yrs old, abusive parents, hard time in high school, bullied all through out middle school, eating disorders, and finally my abortion. I really didn't want to have one, but it felt like I had to choose between my bf or our baby. He apologizes for not having supported me through it, but rather pressured me. I accept his apology except I'm so angry at him. I had no one else to talk to or depend on. Only the baby that I had to get rid of. I love my boyfriend, but a small part of me will always be angry at him. That part of me feels like I deserve better. Only because for a long time he made me feel like I don't matter. I stayed with him because I believed I could make him a better person. It's December and he has been treating me better, but I'm still angry about the way he treated me from the start.
Over the past two weeks I've been taking to this girl I met on tinder, we seemed to hit it off well and swapped nudes and played wow together. A week later I meet her in person and we had sex then 2 days later she took me to a festival and we had a good time, before I left we also made plans to go see the new avengers movie opening weekend. Come Monday the next day she seems distant and is sending short replies. I think it's because she's busy or tired give her some space, the best day she's seems the same but she said she only got 2 hours of sleep so I do the same thing. Yesterday I ask her if she's feeling better and says she's feeling soso, I ask her if somethings wrong or if she mad at me and she says she's not. I'm a little stressed from work and her being distant so I vent a bit to her over text and try to call her but she doesn't pick up, I just leave a message then asking for her to call me. What's going on, should I just want for her to message me back, I don't want to seem clingy but I do have abandonment issues so this is hard for me to do and it really hurts because I fell in love her everything about her. What do I do? tl;dr started dating then out of no where she doesn't seem as interested
Being woken up at night by literally even the quietest of noises sends me into a panic. &#x200B; Voices from housemates, neighbours, music, TV. I guess voices are a trigger...it caused a lot of tension between me and my housemates. As a student as well, I just can't maintain high standards in this way as people are inevitably gonna make noise. &#x200B; I struggle with wearing ear plugs as I have tinnitus, and earplugs tend to draw attention to internal noises. They are also quite uncomfortable! &#x200B; i talk to a therapist and hvae done for a while. It helps, but I wonder if any other redditors have experienced this, and what they do?
I signed up for BetterHelp because my anxiety has gotten much worse lately. After two weeks, I am a bit confused about what the site actually provides. I had a serious panic attack today and messaged my therapist about it. Her response 8 hours later was ‘Complete this assessment on panic attacks’. I have gotten three worksheets so far on social anxiety, negative talk, and this, but not really all that much else? Has anyone else tried BetterHelp? So far, It seems like a computer algorithm could just be sending me these worksheets by picking up keywords in my messages.
Hey reddit. I’ve normally lurked in here, but I’ve had so much happen in the last year I just want to take charge of my life again. It’s just hard because I feel more and more alone in adult life. I’m 27F and I have amazing friends. A great job I excel in and am loved at. My family is great and loves me so much. I love them to bits and pieces and they are gentle and supportive. However I recently lost my bff of 7 years,a romantic relationship, and my relationship with my dad. My family has a history of mental illness and I feel cursed by it. There’s a huge stigma on mental health with past generations of black people so unless you talk to someone younger or more open minded (mostly women) you get called names or dismissed. Bipolar, depression, borderline and dementia all run on both sides of my family. I just wanted to try to find a community to be in that’s also okay with me being anxious... I feel like I’m always tested by how well I can hide my anxiety and not cope with it. Ive been in therapy for years and I’ve gotten so much better. In my relationship when I finally broke down and asked for my needs he broke it off — after I supported him through all his ups and downs me asking for trust and communication killed it. I know I’m a happy loving person but as I try to focus on my future and take charge my skin feels like pins and needles and my mind races. I wanted to sleep and cry. I hate feeling like the bad guy for something I desperately try to control...I just want to feel less alone in it sometimes.
‌My friend told me that someone want to meet with me for some bussines reason. He picked up me with his car and we went to a strange village, really really strange village with weird residence. He drop me and left me for some reason. Im allone at the moment in the midle of nowhere l. I checked my phone, there is no any internet and mobile signal. I cant use google map, uber or even whatsapp. I decide to walk looking for any transportation nearby. The villager are so weird and never answer my question. I run away without any direction, just run. Finally after some hour I found a bus station. I check my phone, there is internet now. I called my friend. He laugh, he fucking laugh, I can hear my other friends laughing so hard in the background. They told me that its just a prank. Im so mad at them, its too much for a prank. I curse them and promise to beat them up. Then I wake up. I dont know at first why I feel so mad. After some moment I remember my dream before. Suddenly I feel sad. All my friends that prank me on my dream are my best friends at college. They have been married and have their own familly, and I havent.
Hey Reddit so I barley joined reddit today for the purpose off trying to see if anyone else here can relate to what I feel. I have really bad anxiety when things cry. For example if a dog or baby cries and I’m alone with it or I can’t help calm it. I freak out. I start to shake, start sweating, feeling like I can’t breathe and just panic. So my problem is my aunt recently passed away and left her two dogs with me. These two Maltese dogs are litter mates and have never been separated before, they also have lots of behavior problems such as not being house broken, separation anxiety, barking and bitting. I have to separate them because I live in and apartment and the lease only allows two pets. My roomate already has a cat so I will be taking the more calmer of the two pups. Will this cause the dogs stress and more anxiety to be apart, are there things I can do to prevent it and is there anything I can do to help me with my anxiety if the dog is very stressed and crying.
My daughter's MIL passed away in her home 3 days ago. My Son in law and daughter have lived with her for the past few years. She got a clean bill of health last week from her GP. My son in law found her dead in her bed after she was late getting up. My daughter was already at work, and called me as she was rushing home. She was sobbing and just said to me *MIL name* is dead! It was such a shock to my heart, and I still hear it in my head. She was a great friend to me.
This friend has been helping me in my business then I find out that she has been seeking advice from a sociopath. She then asks a lot about my business and quite frankly I am not too sure if I want to be friends with her anymore. I don't want to go into much detail as it is quite hurtful. How do I stay clear of her? Should I stay clear of her? I know that it's not her fault and she has been seriously manipulated. I also really don't want to hurt her. Update: sorry I should have went into a bit more detail and thought I did. It's difficult to say but one of the things that was going around was that I did not care about her. This is quite untrue. Also that I did not value her. This is also very untrue. It's quite difficult to explain but I feel that when talking to her she wants to be somewhere else (she is now at the moment). Finally, just want to say at one point I did like her but glad I did not say anything. --- **tl;dr**: Me [40 M] want to stay clear of my friend (F33) who is toxic
Usually, if someone shows any sign of disrespect towards me a fire burns on my chest. It could be an unknown person in the street, a friend, a girlfriend, or a colleague making a question in a seminar. If I perceive it as disrespect, I lose my shit. But only on the inside. Acting like an irrational angry person is not with me. I am sure my facial expression tells it all, but everything else is controlled. The problem is: this feeling clouds my judgment many times. When the fire is out, I always question myself: Should I have really to be angry about that? Should I let it go? Am I letting someone walk over me? I am sure this is common here. I want to know what you guys do to discern the real world from your feelings.
I’m going back to law school next week, and a bunch of communication from volunteering groups, clubs, friends, etc. have started up again. I feel like crawling under my covers every time I think about having to schedule a meeting or return a phone call to someone. It hasn’t ever been this bad before. I don’t even want to answer texts from my friends that are back in town, because that means we need to get together. Ex: I had to send a mass email to a few organizations to see if they wanted to arrange a presentation with my volunteer group. I’ve already received a voicemail and an email in response. The idea of needing to respond and figure out logistics makes me body turn to stone. I just want to ignore it all and pretend I never heard back from anyone... Does this happen to anyone else? Do you snap out of it?
Hello everyone! I am sorry for the throwaway, but it's necessary. I would be really grateful if you could help me with my girlfriend's anxiety. She had some degree of depression some years ago and is doing way better recently, but there's this issue that makes life worse. We have been together 7 years now, and we're both living abroad, but I'll be getting my diploma this year, and she'll get hers next year, and this is destroying her. She just stopped crying now after a discussion I had with her, and she feels that her life is pointless because she doesn't have any friends and doesn't meet new ones because most of her study is done from home, so she doesn't go out if we don't both go out. I have to point out that all her friends live elsewhere now, so she will really be on her own next year, and this makes her really anxious, and even thinks that she would probably just starve to death because she wouldn't feel like cooking because of the lack of purpose in her life. I know that people don't make friends when they stay at home, but at the same time, you can't force people to take part in activities they don't want to, just to make friends. I promised her we'll speak every single day, FaceTime, etc. but I know that it doesn't fix the problem at all. I would be so grateful if you could help me out helping her out. How and what can I do / say to make it easier for her to take part in an activity this year, so that she'll have some degree of social life next year?
I've (16 male) hurt the one I love the most. She (14 female) doesn't believe anything I say. She said she tries to believe me. She was hurt from her last relationship and she was cheated on. I never want to do that and I tell her that but she doesn't believe me. We've been talking for 2 months. I tell her that I love her and she doesn't believe me yet she tells me she loves me. I got upset last night because she called her guy friend babe in front of me and she wears another guy's hoodie and that hurts. She is a very affectionate person to everyone. It just bothers me. Last night she said she would try to be less affection and I said you'll be trying just as much as you're trying to believe me. I know I messed up. She's not mad at me she's just sad and I hurt her. Idk what to do anymore... TL;DR I think I have messed up and I don't know how to make things work.
It was one of the best dreams I've had in a long time actually. For a tiny bit of context, I broke up with an ex over a year ago but still struggle daily (more like hourly) with missing her. I went to prison for a year - had no contact with the outside world for that time. Wheb I got out it was like I had traveled one year into the future. I was just walking around, looking for everyone I knew. As I found each one of them I was so excited and gave them each a big hug. As I was walking around I realized that since a year had passed maybe I had finally moved on from my ex, and I was hoping to run into her. However I kept waking up, and would go back to sleep trying to get back into my dream. I finally got to where I was having a phone conversation with her in my dream, but she just cut out. She was the only one I didn't get to say hello to.
Background: my deceased partner and I were together from 15/16 to 21. He passed suddenly August 16 2020 from a car accident. We had a great but toxic 6 years, most of the stuff I’ve kept to myself. Never told mine or his family any of our dramas. I emotionally left the relationship 2 years ago after he poured a drink on me in front of my coworkers at a party. All because he didn’t want me drinking, so I drank more to poss him off. Anyway, Title says it all. My previous deceased partners parents were happy for me moving forward and said as long I was happy, they were too. I was quite shocked at this response but was happy with it. I told the deceased partners sister and she said “I’m lost for words. Maybe we can discuss this later”. There’s nothing to discuss in my eyes, I’ve moved forward. Why do people expect me to d sad all the time. Why do they expect me to have Bryton live through me? Why do I have to carry the pressure of having his name live on? Why? Why? Why? Why am I bad the woman for finding someone who is extremely supportive, caring, kind, understanding and compassionate? Why? I want to be happy and I’ve found that with this new person. He makes me feel safe, secure, loved and happy!! I need advice. I know Bryton can’t live through me, but I’m trying to move forward rather than be depressed asf. I’m finally in a space where I am emotionally and mentally stable! Advice please & thank you!
I've struggled pretty heavily with anxiety and racing thoughts and stuff for a little over seven years now (25M). I'm currently on 20mg Paxil and things have been pretty okay here and there, but I still have intense anxiety when I'm under stress. In the past, I have had significant anxiety and intrusive thoughts that I endlessly research to try and prove that I'm not going crazy to myself. I used to worry and look up the symptoms of being a psychopath. I knew that I didn't present any of the symptoms associated with psychopathy, but I still had to research it to try and reassure myself. So yesterday I was sitting doing work at my desk job when I swore I heard a voice whisper my name (Chris). I asked the girl who sits at the desk next to me if she said anything, but she said that she didn't. Ever since then I have been terrified that I'm starting to develop schizophrenia and that I'm going to start experiencing more symptoms. This is causing me significant stress, and I can't stop worrying about it. What should I do?
I'm not looking for attention. Some people deserve it and/or need it but neither applies to me. To be honest, I hope no one responds to this. I.. just need to talk about it. Even if no one cares. I'm using a throwaway account because I don't want anybody to know how weak I really am. I cried. For the first time in years. I have a rough life but not so rough I should be in severe depression. However, I am. There was one person I ever told. She was my girlfriend at the time. It's a long story that I don't want you guys to fully know but she knew what I was attempting. She said she was worried about me. Bullshit. She didn't act like she cared at all after that. Which I'm fine with. I don't expect people to care or worry. This is my life, not theirs. We talked about the situation once and that was when she first figured out. We are no longer together and I'm lacking someone to talk to. I'm sitting here just thinking. I will soon delete this account. Probably early tomorrow. If you read this, thank you. Don't think you need to respond though. I'm not trying to be rude it's just these are my problems and I do not expect attention. Nor do I want it. Considering you are in r/sad I assume you're having problems yourself. Take care of them. This is a world where we have to watch our own backs. I'm not saying I wouldn't help you even if I got the chance. I would. I would help you guys out before helping myself out. I know that sounds weird considering what I just said but still.. I don't know. Thank you.
I'm not sure if this is the right sub reddit but I hope it works out. I have been dealing with anxiety for a few years now with it being very strong this year. I love video games like tf2 or csgo and play them a lot. However, all I do is play against bots or on servers that don't really matter for much. When I play with people that actually are trying to play I break down. Once I get killed or make a stupid decision I have a panic attack and start crying.a lot. Lots of negative thoughts go through my mind about how I'm a failure and suck at the game. Even when I'm not thinking about it to much it still has the same effect. I like competitive games when I don't fail or destroy the other team. When I lose in such an event I have the panic attack and go back to bots. This makes me or anxious because I want to get good but playing against bots gives me bad habits. This has gotten to the point that when joining in a game I start the panic and then fail from the panic.its an infinite cycle of anxiety that I want to get rid of even though I breath slowly, understand what is going on, and other coping mechanisms. Now all I do is watch youtube and not do my favorite activity in the world only when the stars align. I've played hundereds of hours of this cycle making me even more anxious. Please help.
So obviously im absolutely devistated. My older brother passed away tragically from an accidental overdose. He was 37 years old. My younger brother wants to see him one last time and has asked me to go with him. Has anyone here got any experience with seeing your loved ones once they have passed. Not sure if i should or not. I have only seen him in person a few times last couple years due to moving to a different town and work commitments. I feel like i owe it to him to say goodbye in person but I am really not sure. Anyone here seen their loved ones once they have departed their bodys. Would you advise for or against it? Any input is welcome thanks
I'm beyond stressed right now. I have to go on work experience next Monday(for two weeks) for college, but I have no idea how to get to the place I'm supposed to be working. I live very close to the college I attend, so I've never had to take the bus before in this city. I don't know how to take the bus. I can't understand the schedule and it's too far to walk. I don't even know which bus number to take. This is all so overwhelming to me. I'd drop out of college right now, but I'm not financially able right now, and I don't know what else to do. Also, we have to wear business casual clothes and this just makes me feel stupid and out of place. I'm in my early 20's but I look 13, so I'm going to feel so intimidated by everyone who knows what they're doing.
I don't even know where to start with this. Um, I'm 24, a woman, gainfully employed, and moderately successful (I guess). I've dated in the past, but after a particularly brutal breakup, serious family issues, work changes, etc. I've been petrified to let anyone in at all. I've always had anxiety, but I feel like it's really turned up to 11 since everything happened. There's a guy who works at a cafe by my office. I want to get to know him, but I have no idea how to break the ice. Any time I'm in a situation that remotely resembles flirting, I clam up. I can't make eye contact, my heart races, and I just want to run. I feel like they can see all of my flaws. I feel too big for the space I occupy. I'm acutely aware of everything I do wrong. I just want to get away from the pain that they're inevitably going to inflict on me. I feel like I'm forever going to be stuck in this lonely state of panic.
First, I'm the bad guy in this story, so please no comments on how disgusting I am. I had an affair with my sister-in-law. My wife caught us and she forgave us both. After, we continued the relationship for a while. Then suddenly she decided to cut me out of her life. She won't answer my calls or texts. It's clear that she wants nothing to do with me anymore, but that pisses me off! I have all kinds of dirt on her; pictures, videos, recordings, and texts that prove she's a slut for being with her own sister's husband. My wife doesn't know that I have all this material. It's the only thing keeping me from uploading it or sending it to her friends so they know the kind of person that she is. I'm just so angry that now she thinks she's all high and mighty. I just wish that I could upload everything and see her face as she finds out and realizes all she had to do was continue to be the slut that she already is!!!
There's this girl lets call her B, so B and I met in the beginning of high school, and from the minute we met we hit it off, we clearly liked each other and soon dated. But about 6 months later, we both left the country and hadn't seen each-other for a couple years, we kept in touch online, but nothing really intense. Here comes the issue, not to sound at all bragging, but I have had since then many chances to date other people, but every time the chance arises I talk myself out of it, thinking I didn't really hit it off THAT great, so why bother to pursue the relationship. Look I'm a kid I get it, but I seriously just want some advice, is this normal? Is there such thing as just knowing whether you should date someone from the get go? But here's where it gets interesting, I happen to be in the same city as B for the first time in years, we meet for coffee and we just kinda catch up, but there isn't really major sparks or anything crazy, it just seems we kinda click well and can just talk to each other, more so than any other girls I've become friends with and have known. Sorry for the essay, this is just something I've been wanting to get off my chest for a while. I'm open to any advice, brutal as it may be so long as it is constructive, is there something wrong with me ? **TL;DR**: Am I delusional about meeting someone you instantly click with or is there such thing as rare instant connections?
i can’t help but feel genuine fear from growing up. I feel like life is going so quickly and there are so many big milestones (good and bad) that my mum never got to see and that i couldn’t talk ti her about. i passed my exams, i started uni at 16, i got my driving license and a car, i had boy trouble, i wanted to drop out, i’ll hopefully graduate in 2 years, getting married, having kids, literally everything. i’ll never have her advice again. i’ll never be able to talk to her about stuff. I feel kinda guilty that she’ll never be able to see any of it. idk if this is just a me thing but i just kinda wish i had my mums shoulder to cry on. a mum to tell all my problems to over a cup of tea. A person that will stay and live me regardless of what happens.
My grandma has been sick with Covid the last couple weeks, after seeing my older sister when returning from a car trip. My sister feels guilty because she got sick after seeing her and my sister tested positive a couple days later. My grandma has been in the hospital for the last few days, was making progress for a day or two but refused the ventilator and was returned to CCU today and signed her Do Not Ressuccitate. I either do not have many memories or have suppressed memories from when I was a child but, those are the only memories I play constantly in my head, the memories from the times I had spent with my grandma. And now a thousand miles apart and no reliable vehicle in her possible last days (Edit- minutes). Edit( she passed away yesterday at around 10 pm, told work she wasn't going to make it through the night and put myself, fiance and son into my little chevy spark I use for work and drove to Texas asap) 1000 miles
For the past month and a half, I have been talking to a girl I know from another school about 40 minutes away. We met at a government club event and have kept in touch ever since. After the most recent meeting where both our schools were there, we kissed and made plans to meet up. We hung out and are still talking. The other day she said, "I don't think I like you as much as you like me". I have no issue with that so I asked, "Want to just keep getting to know each other without any expectations?" She said yes. I'm kind of confused on what to do now and what she meant by her initial comment. --- **tl;dr**: Met a girl. Hung out. She says "I don't think I like you as much as you like me" What do I do now?
So I had a thing where I had to make a model and a presentation google drive anyway the teacher calls me to show my thing and I’m already super anxious so I’m walking up and someone trips me and I fall and then I stutter through the whole thing and btw this was a group project but my partner was absent so I said both our names and accidentally called myself her name as I walk back to my desk I start tearing up and I just have to look away so I don’t lose points for not paying attention to other presentations and I lose 20 points for not speaking loud enough and for not giving enough eye eye contact
will it be like this for the rest of my life? slowly I start to accept loneliness. sometimes I wish I had someone to talk to. sometimes I wish someone would hug me. but there is nobody. I do not trust anyone enough to let him get close to me. The last three years have been the hardest and loneliest years in my life. It hurts to know that there never was anyone in my life who really wanted or loved me. maybe i am just too fucked up and strange to be loved.
20 year old male I've never been in a relationship or had anything close with a girl. Majority of the time if I know said girl likes me in return, I freak out and panic and never talk to them again. About two years ago I went on a few dates with this girl I've known for awhile and on the last date things were getting pretty heated but I got super anxious almost puked and had to drive her back to her car and I went home. I feel so fucking bad doing this to these girls its not their fault I just cannot handle my emotions and then thinking about it makes it worse I don't know, I am super alone all my friends are in commited relationships and I am always left with myself.
Lets call her X. We’ve been together for over a year, and through that year I’ve been trying to get her to understand how my thought processes (Aspergers and Anxiety) can really affect the way I trust people. I never believe any of her compliments or anything she says because I feel like it just can’t be true. Last night I asked her “do you really love me, or are you just saying it to stop me being upset?” And she flew off the walls at me, screaming at me and getting super emotional. She packed up her things shed taken to stay at mine and walked out the door. Cue 20 minutes of me crying in my bedroom, and her not answering any of my messages, then finding out my sister let her back into the house and she was now outside my bedroom door. Hugs and apologies followed. I don’t know what to feel about the whole situation, because I can’t help being scared that she doesn’t actually like me, and I can’t help asking her these questions all the time. She’s fed up of it and I don’t know what to say to her anymore. TL;DR anxiety ridden me asked my girlfriend if she actually loved me. She got pissed at me and faked leaving me then came back 20 minutes later and still slept in my bed.
I've never actually been in a relationship since I got out of elementary, so, for all intents and purposes, I've never been in a romantic relationship. A few days ago I decided to ask out a girl I like. She said she'd like to get to know each other, but that she had some stuff to get straight with herself before she goes on a real date. I'd like to find a way to ask her where she has to be before she feels comfortable with a relationship, but I don't want to push her away with questions that might make her uncomfortable. I have the utmost respect for her wanting to get right with herself before risking a relationship, but I want to know where I should set my boundaries, and I figure she's the best person to help me figure that out, but I could be very wrong about that. P.S. she's been in relationships before, but I'm not sure how recently. Tl;dr: I asked a girl out for the first time and she's interests in learning about one another, but says she's not ready for a relationship quite yet. I want to ask her what that means without making her uncomfortable.
I feel like I can't listen to certain music, watch certain videos, wear clothes I actually like, go to the mall, or post anywhere because i'm not 'cool' enough or I haven't earned the right to like it. I feel unwelcome everywhere. I always feel like I'm the one out. I lurk internet communities or subreddits because I feel like someones going to ask me what i'm doing there/make fun of me/ask me to stop talking. I don't even have any social media, which is pretty abnormal for a 16 year old. I'm even struggling to post this now. I have no interests in anything now because of this. I don't even feel worthy of eating certain foods because I feel like they are above me.
i lost my best friend recently to suicide. i loved him dearly and even though he was an ex, i never pictured my life without him. he was the first person in my life to make me feel entirely comfortable being me. it took 33ish years for him to finally come into my life and after a short 4ish years, he's now gone. life feels really sad and lonely. when i think of my future, i don't see much, and i definitely don't see love. he was my soulmate. no one has ever loved me the way he did, no one has ever made me feel the way he did, and i don't think anyone ever will. what are your thoughts on finding love again after your 'soulmate' passes?
merry christmas firstly, and i’m so sorry to anyone who’s having a really fucking cruel time at this time of year. it’s horrible, and i haven’t stopped crying since the clocks striked 12 (it’s 2am now in the UK) and i’ve just been feeling sorry for myself as I don’t really have anyone to talk to about how i’m feeling. I would’ve been 36 weeks today and my heart is very heavy. i’ve been thinking about how people treat the way i talk about my miscarriage and it’s really starting to bother me. I work with females mostly and one of my colleagues is in her early stages of pregnancy and they talk about their pregnancies, what they can and can’t eat and the little cramps they get and all the great stuff, they don’t know that I have suffered a miscarriage. I can’t talk about it because I know i’ll just cry, but my friends do, and one of them has a 2 year old, she’ll talk about pregnancy and i’ll bring up when i was pregnant and they’ll all just look at me with a blank expression and change the subject. this has happened multiple times, with the same people and family members too. I understand it may feel awkward for them but if i’m openly talking about it why can’t they just help me feel like i’m normal? like my baby hasn’t died? im really struggling to cope and the father of my precious little angel baby isn’t around and I just wish he would support me in any way, or just anyone would.
(Sorry have to post again since the first one was removed) As the title said, I met this guy yesterday and we had a great time together. I really enjoyed it and I think he did as well. And then he sent me message after I went back home asking if I enjoyed the evening. And after we talked a bit I ask if we are going to meet again. He said he doesn’t know because at this moment he only wants some casual fun and he is very happy to have with me. But he doesn’t want to lead me to think in a wrong way. I don’t think I am that kind of person since I never had causal fun with anybody. But I really like him. I am even thinking maybe I should give it a try since I am definitely not ready for a new relationship. But on the other hand I want to be treated nicely and with respect and I also want to know there could be possibilities. So what do you think I should do? TL;DR I met a guy who only wants casual fun. I like him a lot and not sure what to do.
Hi guys, I'm posting for the first time here. I'll try to keep it short. So basically I've been diagnosed with depression last year after spending 7 years without really seeking help. Tried antidepressants but dropped off about half a year later, cuz they just numbed me to everything. So now I'm going back to before, and basically, I'm always sad, even when I'm happy. When I'm satisfied or in a nice moment and I realize that, most of the time I immediately start crying because I know it'll be over soon. Sometimes I get in a desperate, dark pit but most times it's somewhat of a comfortable sadness and I enjoy it more than the inevitable realization that comes with happy situations. Anyone here got any solutions/suggestions, or do I even need any? I don't know how normal I should consider this to be, and whether it's good or bad. Thank you for reading c:
I've known my friend for about half a year now, and he's been a great friend. I met him through mutual friends so everyone knows him pretty well. The other night we were talking and he just said something that weirded me out. He was talking about some of our mutual friends, explaining that he's only friends with them because he knows he can get stuff out of them since they rely on him so much and have no one else. However, he said he can't do the same and "use" me because I'm different (for whatever reason) and that I'd willingly drop him if he were to do anything wrong and ruin him, so he wants to stay on good terms with me. I'm just kind of surprised and unsure of what to even make of it, because he's always been the nicest guy I've known beforehand. Is it something I should be worried about? Tldr; My good friend said he uses our mutual friends but can't do the same to me for whatever reasons. Unsure of what to even think of it.
Uhm hi (gosh writing this is awkard for the first time lmao) (ansbabsbqhd) I don't ussualy have the best eating habits since summer started and now I'm dealing with that and with online school and oop- they don't get better. like breakfast is a no normally and rarely go eat something for lunch as I don't feel hungry or doing work that I need to do from my morning classes or just takeing a mental break form the computer and my desk and just chilling. I sometimes go get me smth after school once I know I can leave my desk....but today wasn't one of those days as I really haven't eaten anything minus a bag of candy..... Ya not the best hehah... Witch brings me to why I'm writing this in the first place My dad is doing work from home and is always in the living room that connects to the kitchen type of thing and so he knows if I go there or not (if he doesn't then he's absorb into his work witch makes sense) when I get dismissed from school is when he has afternoon rush hour basically so it makes sense for this to not to happen but ... But is it to much to ask or heck even selfish to ask or to pormt up or smth for him to bring me food to my room at 4 or smth if he hasn't seen me at all eat smth... It's selfish isn't it...or is it normal to think that way or idk anymore I guess bye?
So my husband and I have been together almost 8 years. We're common-law married, and this September we're FINALLY going to have our dream wedding! And I am already at my wits end with anxiety about it. I'm not nervous at all about making it "official", because he is undoubtedly the love of my life, but I am VERY nervous about all the details and all the people that will be there giving me all of the attention. I've always been a small and meek person, and the idea of all this attention is very daunting. Does anyone have any advice for trying to remain calm and not have a nervous breakdown?
One of the main things I have severe anxiety about is having conversations with people in real time, especially when it's one-on-one. I can do things like walk up and order food or most other day-to-day things that I wouldn't have been able to do 5-10 years ago, but if I'm expected to have a conversation I start to panic. I can talk to people on Reddit all day because I'm not expected to respond right away, and I can carefully plan out what I'm going to say. As soon as it becomes a real-time conversation it causes me a ton of anxiety. That includes things involving online chat, too. For this reason I've been avoiding things that I *really* want to do. For example, I'd consider Magic: the Gathering to be one of my primary hobbies, but I've never played against another human being, online or in person, since I got into it a few years ago. Not playing in person is easy to understand since I'd have to go to a store with a bunch of strangers present and meet new people, and that would make anybody nervous. Not being able to bring myself to play online, however, is really bothering me because it seems like so many people with anxiety are able to get online and chat with no problems. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has stuggled with not being able to chat online and if anyone has any tips to help me out. TL;DR - Can't hold real-time, one-on-one conversations with people, even in online chats. It keeps me from enjoying many of the things I want to do, and it upsets me that I can't even talk to people online (except for on places like Reddit where I don't have to respond right away).
Hi, I (26f) lots both my mum and my granny within 36 hours of each other last year. Recently it was both of their one year anniversary. My granny was in her late 70’s so it wasn’t much of a shock but my mum wasn’t even 60 yet! She had just turned 58 3 weeks before her death. I have had immense grief for my mum ever since she’s passed and it seems to grow every day. Some days are a lot harder than others. I still haven’t registered my granny’s death. It’s like my brain and my body won’t allow it. (I was really close with my granny, she lived an hours flight away and I would ring her 4-5 times a week). I know when I finally register it it will hit hard. I’m afraid to accept her death because I know how immense the grief will be because of the grief for my mum. Going through life events over the past year or watching movies where there’s mother daughter scenes still make me cry and long for the experiences I won’t get now with my mum. Has anyone had an experience with grief therapy? Did it help to lighten the load of your grief?
I apologize beforehand if this text is hard to follow. Experiencing some severe anxiety and have it hard to concentrate. For a couple of days I've been experiencing this menacing anxiety almost all the time. I am on meds and go to therapy (its on a break right now) but the thing I am struggling hard with is self soothing. Does anybody have any good tips on how to calm down or give oneself some relief? My anxiety spikes pretty much from everything, social contact is the hardest. I am working and its been really tough as i feel nervous all the time. The tricky part is that I can be nervous of something then do it and still feel nervous, like me accomplishing the thing doesn't affect my feelings. And this puts me on a loop of being incredibly scared of doing something and then being able to do it but the anxiety won't stop. And I haven't been able to pinpoint exactly why I get anxious, my best guess is that I am afraid to show myself as incompetent and weird. Anybody with severe physical anxiety have any tips or tricks on how to cope with this? Hardest part is that I was doing really well until last week, had the feeling that I got the hang of how to cope with insecurity and inferiority complex but this has me back in anguish.
Hello, I recently became part of the miscarriage club - the club no one wants to join. We stopped growing at 6+1. After weeks of waiting and follow-up appointments, I took misoprostol on May 11. I found the process simple, but the pain was horrid. I've been slowly feeling better. I decided to draw a warm bath and use a bath bomb last night. About 15 minutes into the bath, I got out and thought, well, maybe the bath could be problematic. Naturally, I put my Dr. Google cap on to research and found varying pieces of information. I emailed my doctor about this, as it wasn't mentioned in my initial appt, but I also wanted to see and hear any experiences of anyone may have had in a similar situation. Thank you.
So I have been smoking weed heavily for 6 years now. Almost everyday since I was 15 years old I’ve smoked several times a day and at one point was going through and ounce a week. I have only taken a week long break one time while I was in a mental hospital for my anxiety. I was extremely nauseous, no appetite, mood swings, and my anxiety was through the roof, the usual that comes with quitting. However, I got out and picked my habit right back up again. Here I am a year later and I know it is time for me to quit but I am very scared honestly. Just the thought of quitting can send me into an anxious frenzy. I have really bad anxiety and anger issues that I feel like marijuana masks but I don’t want to live like that anymore. I feel like the only time I’m not an anxious mess or a raging ball of anger is when I’m high and I know that’s not okay... I don’t want to depend on weed to make me an enjoyable person to be around. I know this won’t be easy and I’m not even sure where to start so please if anyone has any advice I would more than appreciate it. Thank you all in advance!
My boyfriend is very toxic and forces me to do things all the time, sometimes physically. I work full time as a teacher and have to come home and cook, something that is hard for me due to a disability. He barely helps with anything himself, and the only bone he throws me is making his 13 year old son do chores as punishment when he is over. Speaking of his son, he's like my own family and hates the idea of two men being together. He throws tons of abuse at me, verbally and physically, and I'm not allowed to discipline him in any way despite being his "step dad" when he needs help with something. Being with my bf has turned me asexual. I don't want it at all but need to give it. He's forced it on me in the past and he'll do it again. I've tried talking to him about these things but I'm too timid. I can't get the words out when I'm facing him when he's being aggressive. I think I might have autism or something. So, in response to "grow a backbone."? I'm asking how. I have hand and feet deformities that 99% of people find appalling. I've had men and women who interest in me in pics without my hands in them and then immediately ghost when I show them or tell them about my condition. I realize it's evolutionary response etc etc and don't need a lecture on that. But the point is that either I fix or put up with things with him or be forever alone. Tl;Dr my bf is overly aggressive and I want to know how I should be standing up for myself.
I called out my STBX on her cheating and she came clean and said she doesn't want to be with me anymore about 2 weeks ago. I handled it better than I thought (I obviously saw it coming) and so I didn't leave the marital home. We are still cordial to each other for the kids and our sanity however, she still expects me to do her honey-do list (I'm still a SAHD until we can figure out childcare) and only spends time with the kids if I'm at my part time job. If I'm home, she's gone and out late, so much so the kids are asking me about it and giving her attitude. I don't want to fight with her so I have been doing what she asks but it's gotten to the point where she expects me to take care of all of the housework and child duties unless she absolutely has to. If she does do anything she complains about how I don't know how to clean properly and how she always has to do it herself. She left me, but wants her slave to stick around.... I'm so lost I don't know where to take a stand. --- **TL;DR;** : My wife left me but still wants me to do everything for the house/kids while she goes out with friends. Where/how do I draw the line?
There this male (same age as me) I met online recently and he is really nice. We talk all the time even text each other via phone. We play computer games with friends online. I really enjoy his company. Problem is I'm already with someone and I wish to NOT take it further as I don't want to ruin the friendship. I thought it was just a silly crush but I think about him almost every night. He lives far away anyways. I don't think I would ever tell him though. I just wanted to share that since I don't have anyone else to tell. But does anyone else have a similar story? tl;dr: I have a silly crush with some guy via onine pc gaming. Although I have a boyfriend I can't stop thinking about this guy who live across the states. Anyone in the same boat?
I’m so tired. I put so much energy into my emotions. It feels like I’m always angry or annoyed about something and it can quickly turn to tears of dissatisfaction and then depression. I wallow in my emotions, I throw them pity parties, and bake each and every one of them their own cake. I’m selfish for throwing these parties. I’m selfish for wanting to eat my cakes and have them too. I can’t desperately want to express my anger and then get mad at myself for doing so. Bottled up or not, anger makes for irrationality. I’m just a puppet under the control of my emotions.
I've been described as an "intense" person. I don't hate life or spend my days angry. However when I work on projects around the house my anger and anxiety of the project go bezerk. My anger gets amplified exponentially when my wife is around. Nothing at all is her fault and she is not contributing to my stress by criticizing me (she in fact gets quiet because she doesn't know how to help calm me down), but if I had to take a psychological guess I would say I'm insecure and have a fear of failing in front of her. My wife and I discussed the roots of the behavior and we believe it may be because of strict expectations my mother set for me in childhood. Anyway, the cause of the anger isn't what I'd like to discuss. There's two issues at play. The original stress and anger of the project, and then the factor my wife has in increasing it (I word that poorly. Remember she is not the cause of any of the stress, just a factor of my stress increasing if that makes sense.) Has anyone had a relatable problem and how did you overcome it?
My grandmother was without a doubt my mother. I took it as a point of personal pride to take care of her. I called her at least twice a day. On the way to work on the way home. A couple month ago I found her in the bath. She had passed very suddenly only moments before I arrived. She locks her house at night. I had to break in. By the time I made it inside I already knew that she was gone. Problem is I keep re living it. Having flash backs. I cried and grieved. But it feels like there is a lump in my chest that won't subside. Thanks for listening.
We've been living together almost 2 years now and it drives me nuts every time. Say it was a small thing (overcooked eggs idc) and we fought big about it. Once we're "done" she will instantly be completely lovey dovey cute. As if nothing happened so to speak. But I can't. I usually need some time to cool off. It isn't much, I'm talking half an hour not 5 days. She won't accept it. If I just stay myself (nothing mean or anything, just calm and just not very perky) she starts to become insecure and will try to get me to make her more secure, which backfires spectacularly the more she tries. Thing is I don't do well on being forced to anything. So when she tries to get me to kiss her or even tries to start some sexy time I will have to stop and tell her I just can't. From then on its all downhill, since apparently I am the only guy in the whole world that ever turns down sex from her. She'll get pissed at me for being "too cold" and say that I am the reason she is so insecure. She'll turn in all so that in the end I apologize for not being something I am not after a fight. I can't be the only guy that has that problem, what do you guys do? **TL;DR;** If we fight anf it doesn't end up in make up sex, we fight again because I take some time to cool off P.S: ok so this is apparently not clear. We don't fight about eggs, it was an example since it isn't about the original fight
I have generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety so I knew college would be easy. And idk what I’m feeling, it’s like I’m disappointed my problem is loneliness and not crippling anxiety. My closest friend is my roommate who I almost never talk to. We both just sit on our respective devices. attractive people make me really nervous and I never have the courage to talk to them in public so I downloaded bumble and tinder and have gotten a few matches but I’m really struggling to find anyone that I can really talk to. I know it will take time to make meaningful friendships but what does that mean for me right now u know? I had to withdraw from a drawing class I was in because I can’t draw without crying and I just feel like such a quitter. What kind of animation major can’t take a drawing class? I’m trying to meet people in my major to connect with but it’s really hard to talk to any of them one on one. We all have similar classes so we just kind of move in one big pack from class to class and I have struggled to have an actual conversation with them. God i hate anxiety.
My dad was diagnosed with cancer at the end of January. Two months later he was gone. As those two months wore in it became clear that treatment wasn’t possible. My dad knew, we knew, he was dying. All his kids came home for his final weeks. We had the conversations we wanted to have. We sang songs together. We held his hands while he passed. We got to say goodbye. It was awful and beautiful all at the same time. No regrets, which I know is a massive blessing. I feel lucky in many ways. We had 35 years together. He was a wonderful dad. After his death I went into overdrive. I wrote his obituary, compiled pictures for the slideshow and wrote and delivered a eulogy for his funeral. I even organized a memory jar and had people drop in memories of my dad, and printed a bunch from the online posts to include. It’s now been just over a week and I’m finally heading back to my own home. I know there’s no wrong way to grieve. I think I’m just curious about what to expect. I have no idea what to expect in the coming months as I’ve never lost someone this close. I also just want to share this story somewhere where people understand. Stories welcome. ❤️
It's like they are trying to worm their way into society. They have been going around saying stuff like the lgbtq+ is going to add a p for pedosexual and I'm losing my mind. The lgbtq+ community has just started to get a better foothold into society and has gotten more accepted but the fucking pedophiles come and mess it up. And they say stuff like children can consent but the truth is and this is coming from another child CHILDREN CANT FUCKING CONSENT YOU DIRTY DRIED CUMSTAINS the only people that say children can consent are pedophiles and the reason I know this is when have you ever heard a child say they can consent. I'm just so frustrated
I'm in college and have had a crush on a girl for months. We've hung out a few times (in a larger group) over the past couple weeks, and a few days ago I finally asked her out. I asked if she wanted to get coffee sometime and she said "yes" without hesitation, gave me her number, and said to text her. I thought it was pretty clear that I was asking for a date. So this afternoon, I asked if she was available for coffee tomorrow afternoon, and she responded saying yes but that her friend (our mutual friend) wanted to join. I took this as her not being interested and friend-zoning me. So about an hour later, I texted back & tried to make my intentions more clear - I said, "To be honest I was looking forward to just meeting with you, but [her proposed plan w/ friend] works. Should we meet [location/time]?" About two hours later, she responded saying, "Oh okay that works too! I'll meet you [location/time]." Now I have no idea what to think. There's clearly some hesitation on her part, and I don't want tomorrow to be awkward. Do you have any tips as to how I should approach tomorrow? Edit: Should I reference our texts at all tomorrow (ie - apologize for misunderstanding, etc.) or just forget about it? **tl:dr**: Crush and I have first date tomorrow, she wanted to bring a friend, I responded that I was under the impression it was just the two of us, she hesitantly(?) agreed.
Yesterday I had to say goodbye to my childhood dog, that I got to have for almost 18 years. She was a hound lab mix, so it’s amazing that she lived this long. But it’s never enough time. My heart aches, I had to say goodbye to my 12 y/o pit mix just 2 months ago. I cant comprehend that they’re both gone. The hardest part for me is realizing that I’ll never get to see them again. Saying goodbye to them, knowing it was the last time. I know they aren’t in pain anymore, but I obviously wish I could’ve kept them forever. During the day I distract myself, but at nighttime, I’m home and can’t help but to think of them. I know you all relate to this as well, it feels like a piece of me is missing. I also lost my first dog when I was a little bit younger, and I was heartbroken. I feel terribly guilty for the fact that I was so young and I don’t remember much of him. I feel like it’s a disservice to him. But the pain still stays.
I lost a friend... We dated for a while but things didn't work out and even though we had promised that we won't let it affect our friendship, things anyway for really ugly... Not a second goes by when I don't miss her. I said a few things and she said few We both have hide egos and I don't know what to do... I have trouble sharing secrets so I can't tell my friends my side of the story and they hate me after hearing hers I don't know what to do but I really want to win her back... As a friend because she is the best thing that ever happened to me
Goodbye my friend, my brother Botch. Since that day, fourteen years ago, on the beach where you, just as a puppy, ran to us, and we adopted you, you have made my life better day by day, be it your derpyness, or your shining intelect, or those eyes, you always brought happiness. Since your health started to decay, I have laid next to you many times petting you head, looking eye to eye, knowing that this day would come sooner or later, but now that it's here, all that preparation I might have thought I did, was for nothing. If there is one thing I will always remember about you, is that even on the days where you had the most pain, when you didn't have the strength to stand, or your bones werent sturdy enough, in your mind you were always that joyful and active puppy, you always tried to ran around wiggling you tail, or climb up a chair to snatch that leftover steak. I saw you move your legs in your sleep, for sure dreaming of those days when you were an athletic and vigorous young dog, chasing the birds on the lake, you were so happy back then, I remember. Your brownish-ginger hair started turning white long ago, but the joy you brought me never went stale. I will forever love you friend of mine, and you will always be with me. I love you Botch, I love you forever.
I had lived down the street from this guy for a few years, we were best of friends. We hung out all the time, playing video games and what not. Then I moved to a different city. It was tough, but we still saw each other ever other weekend, and me and him were still like best of friends. Then he moved far away to another state, and it was tough. We talk to each other ever now and then, and finally after 3 years he moved back. It was like we were best buds again. And then we went to different school, and suddenly it was like, he never talked to me anymore. And id see him every now and again, but it wasn't the same. It's been almost 2 years since I last saw him, and I just want to know what happened. How can someone who has been a close friend for so long just fade away? :(
Recently proposed to my girlfriend and she asked her male friend to be in her wedding party. He's a good guy but we just don't hang out without her so I was surprised when he came to me for help. He said that he doesn't know how to tell her no because he's gay and feels it would send the wrong, feminine message. I don't want him to be uncomfortable so its all good by me, But she doesn't really have any other close friends apart from her sister that will probably be her maid of honor. So she might not have the numbers without him. So we have a bit of an issue. How do we tell her? we haven't really started planning the wedding yet so time isn't an issue (I'm pretty sure that was the only bit of planning that had been done). TLDR: Wife asked her gay male friend to be in her wedding party but he doesn't want to do it. How do we tell her?
I don’t know what to feel other than being completely numb, and I get waves of uncontrollable grief even if I’m driving and have to pull over somewhere safe and just sob. I thought I was prepared for this and I really wasn’t. I’m thankfully working from home so my colleagues don’t see me randomly break down crying. She was a rescue, and we got her when I was 14, I’m now 25. She has always been with me, and helped me with my anxiety and depression. When I was old enough to work, I took over all the care for her. Paying for her food, vet bills, any medicine she needs. Now that she’s gone I feel so empty. I’ve ended up putting her favourite dog bed next to my pillow just to have some sense of feeling that she’s still here with me. Everything is a constant reminder and I’m just in so much pain. I’m struggling to sleep because every time I close my eyes I see her on the vets table looking at me. I didn’t want to leave her and I felt so guilty when I left after she went to sleep. I don’t know how to cope anymore
Hi everybody, hope somebody can help or relate, I have a history of panic attack disorder and anxiety, first panic attack started four years ago, last one two years ago, anxiety is less strong everyday passes by but there is something that's not changing at all, whenever I am lying down and I am feeling anxious, standing up makes me feel uncomfortable for some seconds, I get nausea , empty head and lightheadness and get tachycardia which increases my anxiety, this happens with standing from lying down or sitting down whenever I feel very anxious, if I am not anxious those symptoms does not appear (for example when I wake up I. The morning), I ruled out any cardiovascular disease with ECG, holter and stress test
I’ve been diagnosed at the Cleveland Clinic as having chronic neurogenic stomach pain, which involuntarily induces anxiety. The anxiety is the sympathetic nervous system alarming from the stomach issue. They don’t know what causes it or how to treat it. They told me to try things because there’s not enough research on effective treatments. Anyone find anything that works with this sort of anxiety? What I know: 1. They suggested Xanax. It knocks me right out even at a low dose. Can’t live life on that stuff. 2. Same with tricyclics. I’m a permanent zombie on them. 3. Don’t know about SSRIs yet. 4. I’m on 1800mg daily of gabapentin. Which takes away a little of the stomach pain. But it doesn’t turn off the alarm in my head. 5. Oddly enough codeine helps turn the alarm down. But it makes me stoned and dumber.
Death. The uncertainty, or nothingness of it, is crushing me. It's one of the most common fears, I'm sure, so maybe a fellow sufferer can help me out. It somehow awoke in me to a massive degree a bit over a month ago (along with a moving back in with the parents and going to uni, so we know the possible "cause", not like it really matters) and I've had trouble coping, even though I am currently medicated for it (Zyprexa, along with Bupropion which I take for depression) and starting a new medicine soon (Paroxetine). I was previously diagnosed with social anxiety and depression, and up until recently I was managing myself pretty well. So what's the point of this post? I'd like advice on how you manage the fear (it manifests in some pretty intrusive thoughts for me) and uncertainty. I feel like I need at least something to throw at the big, soul-crushing question that is constantly bothering me. I am in my 20s, married, and generally healthy, though my chest/heart have occasional hiccups. Since faith is usually a central topic when dealing with this kind of fear, I am agnostic. (I hope leaving the actual cause of the fear in the body of the posts complies with rule 3.)
I got sick like two days ago with strep throat. I’ve gotten it enough times to know what it is. My 5 year old had it as well. So when the government shutdown, I had to refile health insurance paperwork during the shutdown which means, even though I applied during shutdown I had to reapply when it opened back up. Which means right now we don’t have insurance. My kids father doesn’t have insurance either and is of no help, so I took my son and I to the er. Not only did I have my other kids with me cause their dad wouldn’t pick them up, but I still had to put him down as my emergency contact because I have no one else. I know damn well that their dad wouldn’t do a damn thing if I was dying. I never ask for help unless I need it and I asked for his help today because I still can’t talk at all and my fever hasn’t gone away. He came over for 20mins if that and got mad cause I didn’t want him going threw my mail. He acts like this every time he has a date lined up with some whore but gives me the most shit when I ask for his help with his kids. Like it hurts to know he would rather go take a bitch out for valentines instead of watching his kids. Mind you this man doesn’t pay child support or get anything the kids need I do it all my self. I’m so tired of feeling any feelings for this immature boy, and I’m so tired of doing everything my self and it’s so hard to not give up. I don’t know what to do.
Hi, me and my fiancée have been together for 10 years I'm 29 Male my partner is 26 female recently things have seemed a bit off between us and I couldn't work out why she was going out more without me seemed different around as in not interested we spoke about things she said she was happy and everything is good. She was out one night and didn't come home and I saw her old phone in the draw I had a look through it there were no messages of any sign of anything going on but in the deleted photo album there was about 20 different naked selfies or selfies in lingerie none have been sent to me though I can't bring myself to talk about what I've seen as I do love the girl maybe I'm scared to find out the truth, am I being stupid to think they weren't for another man? **TL;DR** found naked selfies on girls iPhone what to do Sorry to post same thread again old one got removed and can't comment on it!
Im not sure where to begin this story so i'll just start from the beggining, also im not the greatest at telling stories so bare with me. Today around 2 am I got bored and decided to go on omegle to chat around on the text. As I was going around I eventually I met this girl. I never even knew her name. She was 16 and I am 15. Me and her spoke about her parents being drunk and abusive and how she was almost raped that day by who I suspect was her father, she didn't say and I felt it would be innapropriate to ask. I told her to call cps and sent her the link to the website. She didn't want to call them as she was afraid to. She said she also had a sister she took care of and didn't want to leave her behind. I thought I was doing great in helping her. Then she sent a message that just said "Im probably gonna kill myself soon". And then immediatly left. What am I to do when my best isn't enough and causes the death of a 16 year old.
Ive recently found that it’s impossible for me to trust an employer - instead I’m constantly looking for things to be concerned about. I’m afraid it’s going to make it impossible to ever have another long term job. I’ve admittedly had a series of bad work experiences - all of the below being different jobs. I feel like they almost always got even worse when I tried to find a better situation... 1) Was told told not to tell anyone else what I made in salary - because it was way, way less than anyone else doing half my work. 2) Someone was mad I reported to someone else and not them so they spread false rumors about me. 3) 14 hr days, and he’d grab my arm, slam doors, cold-shoulder, and tell me horrible things about myself and my work. No help from HR. 4) She kept her own copies of staff files in her office, and didn’t treat salaried employees according to legal policy (took paid time from them). It’s all led to awful mental health and anxiety. I have been recently questioning my new job because I’m a 1099 for them, and I’m being seriously treated like an employee. I’ve started feeling angst again, every time I’m asked about my start time, or criticized about my email grammar, or being negotiated down from my asking price. All I see now are red flags. And I don’t know where to draw a line for myself to just, stop worrying. Am I just over-examining things? Is it normal to be able to trust your work environment? Maybe I just need to realize not only that no place is perfect, but sometimes perfect isn’t always “following all the rules.” Am I crazy?
So I was walking home after buying my dinner when I heard a loud crash and loud crying noises afterwards. I immediately ran over to him and saw that he had broken one of his legs and it was bleeding quite a lot. He can't walk and was just howling in the middle of the street. I couldn't move him to the side because I was carrying things and he was quite heavy. Then a few more people came and helped move him to the side. Side note, my college is in a complex of its own so there's no vet around here. So right now we're taking him to the nearest hospital. I hope he's okay :( And for the guy who hit him and just ran away, FUCK YOU Edit: The dog is fine guys, he just has a cast on his leg for now, but the doctor said he'll have a permanent limp later. One of the guys took him to his nearby college. If I ever see him again, I'll take a picture for you guys :)
I'm very anxious right now, because I have a fear of being sick to my stomach. My friend had a 24-hour stomach flu type thing on Thursday the 20th. She wanted to hang out that Saturday but I was busy and also very nervous that I'd catch it. We ended up hanging out Tuesday (so five days after she was sick). When we were hanging out, she wanted to try a sip of my drink. I told her I was afraid of getting sick, but she acted like I was being ridiculous and took a sip of it anyways through the straw. Now, it's four days later, and I'm still anxious that I could catch the flu she had. I've been feeling fine and even forgot about it because I was busy, but tonight I remembered and have been panicking for the past hour. I started feeling weird, like my chest felt weird and my stomach felt tight and my pulse starting racing. I've been sweating too. This made me freak out even more than I might be coming down with it, even though I don't feel nauseous. I'm not sure I have had a panic attack before, maybe only in social situations because my main anxiety is social. But could this be a panic attack? I'm feeling a bit better now but still a little "tight" in the chest. I'm hungry but can't eat because I'm scared I'll get nauseous. I don't want to sleep either, because I'm afraid I'll wake up feeling sick and will starting throwing up. But I have to sleep soon, I'm scheduled very early for work tomorrow. I don't know what to do to calm myself. My mind is forcing me to think that I'm getting sick :(
She broke up with me suddenly. I did NC for 2 days. She texts me back claiming she is willing to work things out. Tells me crying. She's scared of things not working out. She says she needs to see improvement. I try to see her all week, take her out on nice dates. Not once does she let me see her or she makes up the simplest excuses to avoid any contact. She has this thing were she likes to act like a tough person. She doesn't like to show emotion. I got fed up and asked her if she's still willing to get back together if not I'll leave her alone. She responds with "I don't think so". So I thank her for killing my hope, I felt desperate, anxious for days. I was confused as to if she wanted to get back together or not. 10 minutes later she texts me asking if I'm watching the football game. What do I do? Obviously I have to move on but this is my first serious relationship and don't know what to do now? **TL:DR:** Ex breaks up with me. I go NC for 2 days. She tells me she wants to work things out. I say okay and try my best all week. She ignores me most of the time and makes up excuses to not take her out. She wants me to be more romantic and do more things but not once does she let me do it. It's like it's fun for her to see me desperate. I ask her after a week if she's willing to get together if not I'll stop talking to her. She says no. Than 10 minutes later asks me, "Are you watching the game?". What do I do?
So I (19F) caught feelings for a really great (22M) guy. And I'm leaving in a month and a half. Like he's basically everything I've ever wanted. I just don't think he feels the same. I know part of this is me being excited that I've found someone for the first time in a while. The thing is that he's just not showing if he feels similarly. He's carefully keeping me at arm's length, but when we're together it's really amazing. He lets me be affectionate and cuddly, and I ask him if it's okay and he says it is, and he always kisses me goodbye. So I'm wondering what I should do? I'm keeping myself from texting him too much. I just can't stop thinking about him. What can I do to lock up the feelings I've caught and not ruin what I have by feeling too much? TLDR Caught feelings, don't want to catch more. What can I do?
I wanted to share something that \*might\* be helpful to people after I had an (albeit minor) epiphany relatively recently (March). Then I turned it into a long setup for a bad joke. During my \~2 years psychodynamic therapy, questions always came up about my parents. Eventually I realised that their controlling behaviour connected to my anger issues via motivational, depression and anxiety problems. I think a lot of people are angry because rather than being negotiated with, they've been bullied into doing things in accordance with whichever "authority figure" is making the demands at the time (e.g. parent, school bully, teacher, manager). They haven't been taught to take joy in things, because the authority figure doesn't care about that. They've just been taught "do as you're told or I'll hurt you". The error is carried forward from early brain development, partly because the way memory works is to remember the last time you remembered it, especially if it invokes emotions. These people are less likely to trust people, so they're more likely to be in fight mode, and that's where the anger comes in. Something, no matter how small, goes wrong and they're ready for an attack. They're ready to deal with whoever is going to turn up and be an asshole about whatever went wrong. I've chosen to call this "Toilet Syndrome", because: 1. You're more likely to expect an asshole. 2. I like inappropriate imagery.
I recently was let go from my retail job for shoplifting and it was enough for Grand Larceny in my state. It was a large amount and right now no one knows besides the Loss Prevention, me and my former boss. I am very embarrassed to bring it up to anyone but I need help. I don't want my mom to tell anyone in my family but she is known to gossip. Also, I feel extremely disappointed in myself and overall feel like a bad son. I'm slowly freaking out and I don't know who to talk to or what to do, any advice is helpful please TLDR: I committed a crime (Grand Larceny),I am very disappointed in myself and am too embarrassed to ask for help from my mother
I live in the far east of Russia and I hate my state and some people living in my country. I'll explain why. In my country there are big problems with laws and salaries ($ 400-600 per person per month). But at the same time, we spend huge sums on the construction of stadiums that will not pay off their value for another 5 centuries, while this money could go to the organization of production in the country, which would give jobs and salaries to people. But my anger in this post was kindled by people who live in the cities where the Fifa 2018 matches will be held. Instead of giving a warm welcome to guests from other countries, I see how my fellow citizens rob our guests and make money for prostitution. The robbery is that they rent you an apartment for a cost of 10 + times the usual cost of renting a home. So for example to rent an apartment with two rooms for a month is $ 350 + per month, and you rent them for $ 4000 + for ONE DAY. Think about it. And our girls, using the influx of tourists, divorce them for money, in exchange for sex. All I wanted to say is that it's not pleasant for me to realize that my country will be associated not only with Putin, vodka with national creativity, but also with greedy and dissolute people.
She's only 9 months old, and got sick about 2 days ago. At first I thought it was just indigestion as she was just vomiting white foam, which I'd seen before and it resolved itself. Last night she vomited bloody foam, and I took her to the emergency vet where they determined she needs surgery. I took her to her regular vet this morning and they confirmed the opinion of the emergency vet. They think she has a string inside her that has bunched up around her intestines and is lacerating them. Surgery would cost around $900, and I got approved for CareCredit up to $1000, but my dad said that if I go through with it he will not pay for my college (I'm starting back in 3 weeks for the first time in 5 years). Right now I'm just trying to figure out how I'm going to cope with this. I have no idea what to do. I'm really upset and waiting to hear from the vet about how her tests go, but my hope has dwindled to pretty much nothing at this point. It's tearing me up inside, I love my kitty so much and to think I may have to let her go because I don't have enough money is killing me. I will never get another pet, I never want to be in this situation ever again.
i was going out with this girl and yesterday she basically did a 180° with our relationship, but i still had a date with her today. she told me that we're better of being friends but she still went through the whole date, even when i asked her this morning if she still wanted to go because i hadnt talked to her last night. now im by myself, i swear to god the only thing i can love without getting fucked up is my cat because its easy unlike other fucking humans which i apparently struggle with. i dont even know what i should do, i usually bury myself in homework so im not focused on my problems but i did that yesterday now i have no homework. i still love her though, fuck these feelings
I'd like to preface this with my heartfelt sympathy for each of you. I know my experience can't compare to many of yours. I didn't know I was pregnant until I wasn't anymore. We're fortunate enough to have a family. We had decided we're done. Every fiber of my being wants- needs a baby in my womb. I know it wouldn't be for the best. But this was an accident. The only possible way it would happen, happened, despite all odds and then it was over. My very last chance is gone. There will never be another accident now. And I didn't feel it. I didn't know. How could I not know? I wish I could've felt that feeling again, one very last time, even if it would be taken away. My first pregnancy also ended early. But this time, there's no hope for next time. There's no trying again. There's no reassurances. It just hurts. I don't know where to put this feeling, I can't carry it around with me. It's crippling. It feels like I will always feel like this.
Just moved out of her house that I stayed in with my step father since she died and it’s making me miss her so much. I want to text her so badly. Being in the new place with my friend is good but It also feels like when I was a kid at a sleepover and felt scared and alone and wanted my mom to come pick me up. I just miss her. I want to text her so badly I just wish she was here. I need the comfort of my mom in my life still. I’m young and if all goes well still have a lot of life left to live and I can’t believe I have to go through it all with out her. I just need her. How do you cope when you’re just so desperately missing the person you lost? It feels unbearable sometimes. Change in my life makes it so intense. I feel so alone in the world with out her. This sucks!!!!
dude this guy i was involved with freaking found my old reddit, hence this new one. i basically turned him down, broke his heart which in turn broke mine, and wrote all of the deepest and most private thoughts on here. and he found it and read it all. when he told me, i was shattered. that was for NOBODY to read except me and fellow strangers on the internet. he read my most inner thoughts WHICH WERE ABOUT HIM. i wanted to die. and now i cant even look at him, out of mortification and disgust he would do something like that when he knew how private it was to me. he "just had to find it." so yeah. thats why im here. rip me.
My girlfriend and i have been dating for about a year and i love her. But i have difficulties trusting her around men. I get upset when she talks to one and am always accusing her of cheating. She was raped and molested and broke.up with me because she was scared of what i would think. I got her back and i don't want to let go. But i have night terrors. I have dreams the guy will come back and do it again. She dated another man when she left me to feel safe and they had sex. She lied to me for 3 months about it and when i found out i broke my hand. Hes on the night terrors too. I used to have to cut to make them go away and feel peaceful. But mow i just bottle everything up.. this isn't me asking or Wyoming for help i just needed a place to say all this to. Thank you reddit for being with me through everything.
Not trying to be edgy, emo or whatever the fuck I’m a happy guy usually and I’ve met someone who makes me happy just by being with them but I’ve had a rough couple of months full of failed exams and depressed states and over the last couple of years I’ve had multiple good friends betray me/move away, so I’ve had this friend for a long time now and I thought I had found a lasting friendship till he started declining hanging out like we always did saying he was sick or busy but then without him realising i knew he was lying about because I saw photos of him out with different friends this understandably made my trust issues worse and via other bad shit ( being broke , parents splitting,etc ) I just fucked up my life with reckless behaviour and overall not trying . I tried to kill myself earlier this week too but that failed royally so now I’ve took some blood thinner, put on some Jeff Buckley , wrote a short note and am considering slitting my wrists longways and just ending it all so if I don’t post again see yall in hell Ps: thought I’d add one of my favourite quotes from a tv show called derek “I’m not a failure because I didn’t succeed, I’m a failure because I didn’t try”-Kev I thought it might apply EDIT: Christ either my knife is blunt or my skin is fucking thick EDITP2: the person I mentioned at the beginning just called me and just by hearing her I think I won’t do it I’ve put my knife away and I feel a strange peace
I have thought about this for awhile but would like some opinions. I am 25f and consider my mom my best friend. I grew up with my dad because my mom was addicted to drugs and we moved out of state for my dad's work. I visited my mom from 8-18 and now we talk daily. She has been sober since 2001. My dad never talked poorly of her and always allowed me to spend school vacations with her even though he didn't have to. I love my dad, of course, but he is very stern and I don't talk about 'woman' stuff with him. He has taught me a lot about life also. I'm 17 weeks pregnant with my first and both parents have been supportive of hubby and me. On the other hand, my husband's ex has always said their daughter, now 12, is her "best friend" and would use it as an excuse to not allow SD to come over before they got a court order. I see it a lot on social media. It just weird me out and while I love my SD and future daughter, I can't imagine being "friends" with them. However, with my parents (especially my mom), I feel like I can tell them anything or almost anything and they won't judge me. I still ask them for advice and respect their opinions. They've been on this earth 23 and 30 years longer than me, I appreciate all the input they'll give me. **TL;DR** **do** **you** **feel** **like** **your** **parents** **have** **become** **your** **friends** **after** **becoming** **an** **adult?**
I had to go to school yesterday, so i went to the bus (this happened yesterday). I showed my cart and was able to get through. A lot of shit happened in my live, so i was already pissed off, but this makes it even worse. I was standing somewhere, because all the seats were taken. After a little while some people left the bus. I saw a chance to take a seat and relax, but then i heard LAD COME OVER HERE NOW. I was confused, but the good guy inside me thought let's just go there, I didn't do anything wrong, so what could it be. The bus driver said "good morning" on a violent tone, I said good morning and he starts yelling GET OUT THE BUS NOW. I know i did nothing wrong i tried to say, why? But he was almost pushing me out of the door. After 2 sec being out of the bus. I was going mental. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG FFS. STUPID BUS DRIVER.....
I was seeing a guy for three months. It was pretty physical but we would always do something beforehand, like get food or watch a movie - so it felt like we were dating. He had introduced me to many of his friends, including co-workers and childhood friends. Recently he told me that he was too bogged down at work (works in management consulting) and couldn't commit to me. I told him that I was starting to develop feelings (he said he could tell) and that if I didn't want to get hurt down the track, I should probably back out. He agreed, so we stopped seeing each other. But is "work" a legitimate reason for a guy not to want to see if a relationship can develop with someone? Or did he just use that as an excuse because he didn't like me? He never told me that he actually liked me - I guess I just assumed that he did, because he would ask to see me when he was free. Or was it just about the sex for him and did he freak out when he realised I started to develop feelings? &#x200B; TLDR: was seeing a guy for three months, he could tell I was catching feelings, he said he couldn't commit because of work, but wondering if that was just a nice way of saying "it was just sex and i don't like you like that"
My boyfriend is very angry, he rants and raves when watching shows, drives aggressively and talks in great detail about how he would of solve a problem (generally with violence) He is a very passionate person, any shows about injustice make him insanely mad. I am looking for advice on how I can support my boyfriend to express his emotions but also support him to chill out, so I can enjoy the show with him. It does my head in and I generally need breaks from him, I don't want him to feel rejected but his aggressive energy is intense. Any tips, advice, dos and donts Thank you
That's all. I just miss him so much. Just the thought of him not existing anymore is so unbearable. The thought that all that's left of him are these ashes and that I will never see him again or hug him again or get to talk to him even once. Why did he have to go? I feel so lost without him. I didn't really saw when he was still alive but he was the one that I could always rely on when things went completely wrong. He had my back even when I was a bitch about it and pushed him away. He cared for me so deeply, I just wish I could hug him again and tell him how grateful I am that he is my dad. It's so hard without him. It's even harder than before and you only realize that shadow that has always been there to give you stability when it's gone and you can't ever get it back. I miss him so much. I wish I could go back.
So our baby died at 16.5 weeks, I delivered at 17 weeks. This was my first pregnancy. It’s been exactly 3 weeks since I delivered.. I’ve been bleeding and cramping on and off since then.. I’ve found after a night of drinking my bleeding worsens and gets heavy as well. Especially in this past week I’ve had more cramping...and bleeding again.. but only for like a day at a time.. It switches off between brown and red blood. How am I supposed to tell when my period comes? As of the past couple days it only comes out when I sit on the toilet... I called my doctor but she hasn’t gotten back to me. Very confused haha
even though we had anticipated and are of course genuine happy for them, today we found out that our bil’s family are expecting. it’s only been a month or so for us and I was just starting to feel like myself again. what makes this excruciating is their due date is literally the same due date we had before we lost.. (not to mention the spacing we’d hoped for since we’ve already had Covid related delays and gender my husband and I hoped to experience as parents) they announced to the whole family in person yesterday and no one thought of filtering conversion miscarriage in front of us and my mil (who had already known and had their moment of celebration) kept going over the top directly towards us as a couple with no regard for it possibily being painful for us even though we expressed our joy for them trying to have faith, sometimes life can be so cruel..
I lost two family dogs in 9 weeks this summer. This was my first pet loss since they were my childhood dogs. I have a dog myself as well as a cat and when they're gone I don't want any more. Sometimes while I'm petting my 9 year old cat I stare into his eyes and think about the day when I have to pay somebody to kill him and hold him as his body goes limp. I'm so mad at myself for getting these animals and bringing so much grief to my future self. Life is hard enough already. ETA: if someone happens to see this please don't try to convince me I'll change my mind. That may be true but right now I really don't see that changing.
I’m young and I should be excited to grow up and get to experience life, but I’m not. I’m getting older but I feel like I’m not growing up. I still want to be a dumb young kid with no responsibilities just having fun. There isn’t anything really motivating me to pursue life. It just seems like all we do is work, grow old, and die. I don’t wanna have to get older and see my friendships disappear, or see my family die. The thought is just killing me inside. I pretty much just constantly occupy my mind with mindless activities all the time so that I don’t have time to think about these kinds of things, but it means that I basically have no hobbies and I have very few passions in life. I’m barely an adult and I already feel like I’ve wasted my life. I feel like if I found something I was passionate about or someone who could show me the beauties of life I’ve rn ever experienced, maybe things would be different. But it feels like my life is never interesting like that; I’m just a boring background character in someone else’s story. anyone else feel the same?
So at my job, a full time employee is split over 2 3-4 hour shifts and you can choose which shifts you work. My first shift was detremintal to my mental health. My manager is so disrespectful and doesn't treat my anxiety like it's a real problem. He shuts me up when I try to explain why I'm agitated and about to have a panic attack. Well today was the final straw. It was a rough day, no one was doing what they were supposed to be doing, and he was making stupid calls that only upset everyone. And instead of listening to our concerns and reasoning, he just ignores us all and makes us do it anyways that would make us get out super late. I had too much on my plate, couldn't handle everything I had to do and he just didn't care. I walked out, but I am planning on coming to my next shift since it's completely different managers, ones that understand my mental health disorders and work with me. I won't have any repercussions on my next sort for walking out, but my anxiety was so bad I was scared I was going to have a heart attack. I do not plan to return to that shift and will be switching to a different shift. But my heart is still beating so hard and I'm super antsy. I just worry if maybe I was being ridiculous and should have stayed, but part of me is saying I have to take care of myself and my mental well-being. Maybe I'm just overthinking it.
Hi there, I’m totally shattered. I’ve been with my boyfriend for over a year now and I love him deeply. We get along great, or so I thought. He’s often away because he’s not from my hometown and will often go back to his family. I’ve always been okay with that, even though I often felt lonely because he’d never really write me when he’s gone, except for 1 or 2 messages. I never really thought much of it because he doesn’t really like being on his phone anyway and I didn’t wanna annoy him while he spends some quality time with his family. I also get along with his best friend and met up with him today because we hadn’t really talked for a while. He then told me that my BF said that he doesn’t actually like me. I’m so confused and shocked. He had told me that he wants to be with me in the future and even introduced me to his mum. He invited me to go on vacation together. I’ve always trusted him. And now I’m feeling horrible and worthless. I’m not more than a distraction for him and he doesn’t see anything in me. How could I be this stupid? How should I proceed? What can I do to stop feeling this horrible? :( *TL;DR* BF of one year told his best friend that I’m not more than a distraction for him despite acting like he loves me. Now I’m feeling absolutely worthless. Thank you in advance, I really appreciate it!
So basically I (18M) was at a point with this girl (19F) in college where we both liked each other but she kept giving very mixed signals and didn't really make an effort to do anything about us. Mixed signals as in continuously suggesting we hang out more often, telling one of my friends she liked me and wanted something more than our friendship etc... We were friends before all of this but not super close so we would never normally talk deeply about things. Whatever was there obviously didn't work out so I'm wondering how I should approach trying to be friends again. There was no fallout or anything, it just feels a little awkward when I see her because I think she knows that she was kind of wasting my time and maybe feels bad about it and doesn't want to bring it up? Any advice would be great! **TL;DR:** Basically, I was almost dating this girl that I was friends with before and it didn't work out because she kept giving extremely mixed signals and didn't really put any effort into it and I want to try to get back to our original friendship.
My little buddy died last week I thought I would be okay but I’m not I picked up his ashes 2 days ago I started crying I’m supposed to be a grown man,I’m a husband a father to a 3 year old I can put myself together for work and a couple hours after But I come home and I don’t see him I don’t hear him running around the house All of have is the little bit of scent left on his bed next to mine I’m taking it day by day hoping time will heal but I feel worse he’s was only 5 years old going on 6 He was the best pup in the world He loved me and I loved him I never thought at almost 6 years old I would be saying bye But the fact that I won’t be able to feel his warmth against my skin while we sleep anymore is never coming back kills me I just hope there is a heaven cause that’s where he deserves to be I’m not particularly religious but if there is a god please take care of my bestest friend til I can see him again And love him with all you can give Edit : thank you guys for all the advice and support
Hey all. 3 weeks ago I had my first panic attack, followed by an intense anxiety that lasted for about 10 days. It was hell, my body was shaking uncontrollably, my mind was racing in every direction and I was constantly feeling like I will lose my mind. With the help of my mother and my therapist, the anxiety is almost gone right now. From enveloping my entire body, now its like a tiny ball inside my chest,barely noticeble. My problem is that I feel like shittt. For the last 3 days (since my anxiety has gone away) I wake up feeling like I've been drinking the whole night out. My eyes are heavy, my head is pounding and my mental acuity is damn low. I found something online about this, I think it's called anxiety hangover, but I wanted to hear from you too friends.
My bf and I have been together for just under a year, his step dad has done a number of things over that time that make me feel uncomfortable. One time in front of his wife (my bfs mum) and my bf he openly grabbed my butt claiming he was feeling how baggy my pants were and nobody said anything. Another time we were in the kitchen and he was drunk and he came up behind me and started rubbing my shoulders and massaging my scalp, I was very uncomfortable my bf told him to stop but he kept going. His wife just stands there. He always calls me gorgeous or sweetie, which I would overlook if the touching wasn't involved as well. He always makes comments to me and my bf about our sex life, what i'm wearing, and makes sexual innuendos about me to my bf. I'm not sure what to do, I want it to stop and so does my bf but he feels awkward saying anything as its his own family. The worst part is that this is always in front of other people, and everyone just lets it happen. --- **tl;dr**: My bfs step dad inappropriately touches me in front of his wife, how do I make it stop?
I don't mean big things, like missed trips or life events. &#x200B; but how have you been handling all the little things they left unfinished? Books, series, movies, games, etc? &#x200B; I recently restarted playing a game we had started over a year ago. we stopped for various reasons but had wanted to finish it. i almost immediately finished a section that had frustrated us prior. and then i hated myself for not sticking with it then and getting mad, leading us to her eventually never finishing the game. There's also a handful of game's and books she gave or recommended to me, that I'm slowly working through. She had wanted me to play Dragon Age Inquisition so we could discuss character decisions. Now i'll never know her judgements on mine. &#x200B; I feel good when i finish these things, and the games are good, but the whole experience just feels so gray.
I effed up and got angry at work. I’ve been doing so well as of late without any incident at all. I was in my workspace pulling items out of a deep crate, when a customer comes up and just blurts out what they want while my back was turned. I start maneuvering the items in my hands around to lay them down, when again they blurt out the same thing. I turn around and just say “hey, can I get a minute?” With both my hands full. They look and say “oh, um yeah that’s fine”. I felt awful afterwards, for one being a manager at work and needing to set an example, and two for being rude to a customer.
I (23) have been with my bf (28) for half a year. I had two relationships before which lasted all around 2 years. I ended both of them because some things went very wrong (one had very low self-esteem and therefore had many issues and the other one had verbal anger issues) My current boyfriend and I get along very well. We share the same humour and values. But he is a very attractive guy and has a past on cheating on his partners. He also never really does anything for me and keeps everything as comfortable as possible for him. He also prefers to spend a lot more time with his friends... which is fine but we rarely have quality time together. I mentioned all those things to him but he just replies with „please let’s not argue babe, everything has been going so good“ etc I know that sooner or later I will break up again. I just want to be fair and do it now but I can’t. I am so used to being in relationships even though all of them were pretty shitty How do you break up even when problems are significant but there is not one problem that is an immediate deal breaker. And why do I have this pattern of having shitty partners? TL;DR! How to end it with Someone even though there is not something awfully wrong
on the one hand i dont think marking my things nsfw even thi they are in suggestive poses is going to do anything for or against the group as it is not a rule in the sub, on the other hand what the fuck do i know? im just an outsider looking in and as im trying to be civil about this im just getting more and more pissed off because fuckface doesnt think that this is something he could just say over dm be alittle courteous and not jam up my already failing post holy fuck!, im ashamed of the way that i lashed out but i also want to just wring this fuckers neck, i made my argument of how i dont agree with it and i tried to just shrug it off by saying “whatever man” and then they have the nerve to tell me im being immature........i didnt start swearing at them at first or anything i tried to be nice and just say shit like thats your opinion but they just keep pushing and fuck, there im done and now i just want to go to sleep
The worst fear of my life came back. Imagine watching something slightly scary. Just a bit horror. Ok now imagine being really scared of that thing. OK THEN, imagine having a non-stop feeling that the thing you're scared of the most is in the room with you. OK NOW I HAVE THAT. Help I constantly feel like the horror creatures I'm scared of the most are with me, in the same room, waiting for the right moments and watching me constantly. I can't sleep Sometimes I'm paralysed with fear and stay still in one place 5-20 minutes. this sometimes happens during the day. I just feel like these monsters are always with me , chasing me when I'm running, watching me when I'm sleeping, waiting for the right moment to strike. ANYTHING that at the moment I'm scared of the most is now my hunter. It's like hide and seek, but deadly, unknown, with monsters and the seeker is always there, watching you, silent, waiting to deal the final blow. For example,according to my senses, that monster from Dark Deception is behind me right now and I'm too scared to turn around. ACCORDING TO MY STUPID IMAGINATION THAT THING IS WAITING TIL I TURN AROUND SO IT CAN COVER MY MOUTH AND KILL ME IN SILENCE. help me This got out of control. RIGHT WHEN I THOUGHT I GOT RID OF IT IT DISAPPEARED AND THEN IT CAME BACK, BUT MUCH WORSE.
About this time our sister had just picked me up off the ground and walked me to the porch where I sat for the next day or so, tears continuously falling down my cheeks from behind my sunglasses. Lots of people were there, there were the police officers that stayed all day to manage traffic, the relatives dropping off food that wouldnt be eaten, the relatives trying to put themselves in the spotlight, really everyone but you Joey.. You would be so proud of us brother, I didnt think we'd make it for a while there but I think were finally pulling it together. I wish you could see how much better my life is today, if you were here youd be hanging out at my house helping my husband (who youd love) and I get ready to welcome your 5th niece into the world. I wouldnt be sobbing into your shoulder like I was the week before this awful date asking what was wrong with me, and why the jerk I was trying so hard to keep wouldnt stop hurting me. In so many ways we will never be the same, and we will never stop missing you every second of every day. Were getting there though, each year is a little bit easier. I love you brother, to the moon and back.
As the title says, my Grandfather passed away today at age 94. He passed away peacefully in his own home and in his own bedroom. He now gets to finally be with his wife, and I have never seen the love as strong as the love he had for his wife/my grandmother. He was a stubborn guy, always wanting to do things his own way. He lived alone in his house because he did not want to go to a nursing home years ago, and he rejected most treatment. Looking past this and unwelcome comments from him, our family loves him. With his death, my whole family was crying...except for me. I don’t know why, and that’s why I’m making this post. Why am I not crying? Is this okay? Has anyone else had a similar experience? I’ve thought about it for a little bit now, knowing he was dying helped me prepare for his inevitable death, but it still is deeply saddening. I don’t want my family to get the wrong idea that I am not sad or I’ve set up a wall that has hid my emotions. Any advice, comments about similar experiences, or just general support is more than welcome. Thank you.
It’s a brand new chapter of my life- I’m very excited! :) If you’re suffering- just know that it *can* get better and have faith in yourself! Edit: I am not a therapist, I am not a professional, I am only sharing my experiences and my thoughts here. Therefore I might not be using the correct terms all the time and hope you all could understand. Again, I’m not saying I’m “cured”, but know myself better and able to handle it better. CBT has helped so much and I am recommending people to try if it’s something you are considering. Thanks again for all the positive feedbacks and upvotes, I really do hope everyone here can find something useful and positive, and maybe apply to your life too. Good luck to all of you!
I’m 16 and was just diagnosed with ulcerative colitis I was in the hospital for 9 days and have been out of school since February I am so far behind in my school work that I’m afraid I might be held behind and all my friends will graduate without me I have only eat three foods right for the past few months as any other foods cause me sharp pain and my life is just me in my bed all day. I would love to be outside but I cannot not except for going to the doctors and getting poked and stabbed my friends don’t talk to me they have forgotten me I feel like a burden to my family I love summer but I have to give that up for school so I can maybe catch up I have to drop out of band soccer and swim team just to pass high school I feel like my life is falling apart and there is nothing I can do to help it plus the illness is chronic and has no cure I just want to feel like someone cares
I tend to have big arguments with siblings......Especially my older sister. Well one time, I paused Last of Us part 2 for Dinner and when I came back my sister took control of the tv. She said "Anon (I will use this as my name for the post), It's wasteful to leave the Ps4 and The TV on". Then when she paused netflix during dinner a week later I did the same thing. I took over the TV and turned on my PS4. She got berserk but I told her that she did that when I left the PS4 on during lunch but she gave an excuse "WELL THIS IS NETFLIX. IT's ONLY THE TV THAT'S ON. You had both the TV and PS4 on". We ended up arguing. Another time is I asked her a question while she was watching Money Heist but she told me "Don't interrupt someone who's watching". She did the same thing to me when I was reqatching Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I told her she told me not to interrupt someone who's watching but she was like "HEY I WAS WATCHING SOMETHING IN SPANISH LANGUAGE". So basically the point is.....A sibling corrects me for something they think is wrong. When I do the same thing to them (Role Reversal), the sibling gives petty excuses. I want to know how to deal with those while maintaining calm. Instead of fight. My older sister is like that. She does something that really pisses me off and when the roles switch....she gives excuses and most of these fights start when I call her a B\*\*\*\* for being so defensive and a hypocrite.
So I went out with the girl I've liked for almost three years for the second time ('as friends') and told her that I'd fallen in love with her. She looked down and just said 'wow, I have no idea how to reslond to that'. She then continued what she was doing at the time and as I silently put my thoughts together. I told her I was speechless too. She then told me 'then let's be speechless together' We left on an awkward note for her, i played it cool to relieve some tension. Then as i turned to leave, she opened the arms for a hug. We hugged, then said bye. I texted her that night and i didnt get blue ticks on whatsapp (shows shes seen it) and i knew she was active since she'd seen a status update i put on a few minutes later. TL;DR: Confessed, didnt get a straight response then she didn't view a text i sent that night. 1. What do you think is happening 2. What do you think is going to happen 3. What should I do Now 4. What should i do next
We were a perfect match, she and I had very similar interests, she was the nicest person ever, and she was so gentle and supporting of me. I can't help but feel like I threw that all away. To be honest, the main reason we broke up was because I wasn't into her sexually any more. Like her touching me at all started to get annoying, because of how clingy she got. But is it possible that this issue was something that could've been fixed to keep the relationship alive? I dumped her yesterday and I am now worrying that I made a huge mistake and threw away a girl who was so completely head over heels for me, a girl who truly cared and was willing to help me pursue my dreams. Wherever my dreams took me, she was along for the ride. And I feel like I threw it all away. --- **TL;DR**: Dumped her because the sex wasn't doing it for me, but otherwise she was perfect in every way. Could I have worked through this instead of just dumping her?
After a year of ttc we were ecstatic at the good news. At my first prenatal appointment 2 weeks ago, 8 weeks along, found out that about 6 weeks mmc. Distraught at the options at the time, I chose to wait to see if anything would happen on its own. I didn't opt for d&c because I already have some previous scarring from an ovary removal. Not too keen on surgeries in general, but didn't want to hinder future fertility. A week later, I called my ob to get miso prescribed to just get this over with. Last Wednesday did the first dose, and the second dose shortly after. Days spent in bed in pain and then passing whatever I did. Had a followup today and the u/s still showed a lot of tissue. Going round two of miso and hoping this all just gets through and over with. I immediately deactivated my social media accounts because I can't handle all our friends and family being pregnant, getting pregnant, and just it all. Can't wallow in my misery at home because of extended family living in our home for the time being. I can't take time off of work because I'm literally the only one who knows how to do my job. I just want to grieve in peace, but the world just interferes. I just want this mc to run its course. I'm tired of being envious of others pregnancies, of having to hide my emotions all the time to act like a civilized human being. One day it'll be our turn. Sorry guys. End rant.
Hi guys, I'm a 26 year old man and lately I've been having seriously violent thoughts. I'm 5'9 and I can't stand those guys who are over 6' who run their mouths thinking they're unstoppable. And lately I've been hoping one of those guys picks me as their presumably next victim of ego boosting just so I can beat the living shit out of them with my brass knuckles. I don't look for trouble but I have the shortest fuse in the world when it comes to people that are looking for a fight. I'm scared of myself because I know I wouldn't want to just win the fight I would smash there face in and take satisfaction in knowing I took down the man that thought he was tough shit. It's only the really huge guys that set the switch off in me. Idk I just worry myself.
-Your friends/family members are either super ghetto or proud racists, I stick out like a sore thumb. -Speaking of racist, I hate your "edgy" humor. Saying the N word is not funny! now this isn't me wagging my finger at you I love offensive humor... the N word IS. JUST. NOT. FUNNY. -You don't listen to me when I talk. You don't even try. -You don't even plan activities for your guests, we just sit and play the same video games and the same meme videos on youtube. -You think you have "leadership qualities" but you're just overbearing. bossy, fat fuck who can doesn't like to compromise with others. -and you think being a manager at a entry level job and having a pothead, emotionally unstable girlfriend gives you bragging rights?! What!? Entry level jobs are desperate for managers! I could be hired in as a Taco Bell Manager within a week and just date a coworker lol -If we had communication in our "friendship" I could bring up some of these issues and we'd could work on it but you don't care. You are convinced you are the shit and anyone who challenges you will just be ignored.

I met a girl in Vegas in April. An exciting, beautiful, wonderful girl. I got her number. We texted quite a bit. I decided to pull the trigger and go see her in May and we have, in my estimation, an extraordinary weekend. She was supposed to come see me this weekend, but called it off yesterday. It isn't fair to us because we're not together. Ultimately, she's not wrong, and I'm not *mad*, I'm sad. She excited me in a way that I haven't been excited in years. I've been in a few relationships over those years that were *good* but not **great**. And it sucks to think that geography was the killer. Girls that have excited me like that are few and far between and I'm just sad that through no fault of my own, it's over. That's all. Thanks.
I lost two people this year that mean so much to me. My Grandma(96 years old) on January 1st and my mom (70 years old) passed on January 12th. Both women helped raise me since my father was not in the picture. My Grandma has been struggling with dementia for the past two years and while it’s still extremely hard, I know she is no longer suffering. My moms passing has been the hardest. She passed away unexpectedly after going into cardiac arrest, being placed in a medically induced coma then passing away three days later. I never thought I could feel so much heartache and pain. My brother asked me if I have any significant memories with mom and when I told him about all the little things he said that “he could do the small stuff”. He made me feel like my memories are insignificant. I lived with my mom for 35 out of my 36 years alive, all I have are the little things that I remember most. He made me feel awful. It just added to the feeling of being worthless on top of all the other feelings I already have.
My brother died unexpectedly in January and I thought I was coping as well as could be expected but the last few weeks it’s like my memory and ability to concentrate are completely gone. More than once in the last week alone I’ve been in the middle of a conversation and have my mind go completely blank, sometimes literally in the middle of sentences. My attention span is shorter than normal, too. I used to be able to read a book in one 4-6 hour sitting and now I can barely stay focused for more than a few pages at a time. It’s so frustrating and not like me at all normally. Intellectually, the only thing I can think of to account for the change is my grief but it’s a symptom that I didn’t expect at all and never struggled with in other times I’ve lost people in the past. Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips besides just waiting it out? I’ve tried meditation, grounding, and journaling and none have ever been my thing.
I hope you're resting in peace up there, it has only been 3 days but it feels like my grief will last through a lifetime, i miss you. I wish i could have hugged you more, i wish i could have given you more treats, i wish i could take you up in my arms and finally experience the joy of having you in my world again. This was my first pet at 21 years of age and i couldn't even imagine it would hurt this bad to see him go. It happened so fast, we tried taking him to the vet but he couldn't make it, the scene of him gasping for air doesn't leave my mind no matter how much i try to escape from it. It happened right in front of me and i couldn't do anything about it. I hope he liked his time with us, we gave him treats whenever we could and pet him whenever we saw him wandering around our home. We loved him so much i can't even put it into words, he would lick our noses whenever we put our faces close to him and then jump and twist himself in the air whenever we were all together in the living area. I love you Bento, i hope you loved us too.
In short, my dad passed away a year ago. This week has been hard due to the fact he passed away on the 22nd of August and it’s been rough for my mom and I. Speaking of my mom..she’s struggled a lot and I’m really proud of her because she’s become more spiritual and has accepted that my dad will always be with her and has to keep going for him. She’s read many books about dealing with grief, spoken to many people about their own grief and has connected with many of those who have gone through the same. Although she has her bad days still, she’s doing way better than before and I’m so happy about that. Me on the other hand… I’m not sure if I have truly accepted that my dad passed away. I immediately had to start a new job after his death, and I’ve been constantly distracted with working, having personal issues, I find myself constantly distracted and not really thinking about my dad. I don’t even think I cry about him that much. There are little things that remind me of him and I cry for about ten minutes and go back to doing whatever again. I know there’s no “manual” on how to deal with grief but I’m not sure if I’m facing it at all. I also check in with my mom a lot and make sure she’s fine and it’s been that way ever since he passed. I don’t ever make sure that I’m okay though. I’m 24..I’m going to live a long life without him and maybe I’m just scared to think about him because of the sadness. Any advice is appreciated because I just don’t know how to feel.
So we met at a rocky time for him, and I was NSA due to not trusting anyone (men especially). So I help him get over his abusive ex and get entangled in what seems like the nice, committed relationships I have heard about & wanted. We move in together out of the city, I meet the family, I hear about the exes he "loved", get a job near his so we can commute together, and we somewhat work on selfish behaviors (more me than him). After 5 years I hear about how I'm so "sexually incompatible", but he doesn't share with me, or engage in what I like. Am I stupid for thinking I'm loveable and he might say so? How can I move on if that means I would be homeless & jobless for being unable to get to work on time via public transit? --- **tl;dr**: 5 years, no "I love you"s; is it just a long, pointless rebound?
I adopted one of the sweetest, cuddliest, and most expressive cats in September of 2020 from a cat cafe. My previous cat had been gone for years at that point, and I was so ready and excited to be owned by a kitty again, so I left that cafe with a spring in my step and a lovely 4-year-old cat I named Peach. Peach and I became really tight, really quick. She was my shadow, my writing companion, my rock during the pandemic, and just an all-around great cat. My husband and I fell absolutely in love with her. Her trills, purrs, and the way she tucked herself against me at night was heart-meltingly adorable. She truly was special. This week, FIP cruelly stole her from us. :( She was fine less than two weeks ago. This just came out of nowhere, happening so fast, and we really didn’t have time to do anything or really prepare. I lost one of my best friends, and I feel so irreparably broken-hearted. I can barely sleep or eat, I can’t focus, and I’m regularly breaking out in tears. I miss Peach so, so much and would give anything to hold her again, kiss her little head, and hear her purr or trill. It just seems so damn unfair and cruel. We only had her for a year and a half. She was not even six. Where the heck do we go from here and how do we heal from this?
I learnt that I'll be going to the same college as my best friend, but I'm afraid she won't want to be near me because of my occasional bursts of rage. I don't want to lose her as my best friend, and I want to be as good of a friend to her as she is to me. Even if it only worked temporarily, is there anything that might take my mind off my anger and focus on helping her? (EDIT: I haven't been treated poorly, I've got a great family, great friends, so it's not me being raised wrong, I don't think.)
I did a genetic test and my doctor told me that I metabolize antidepressants too quickly, which is why I tend to have mood swings while taking them. It makes sense: I feel pretty good and energetic for hours until a switch sort of goes off--something I don't experience without them. But when I stop taking them, it slowly worsens until I can't even leave the house. The biggest difference is in my body. It aches, feels sore and *very* heavy without them. My mind races with anxiety. With them, I am light and have the energy to face the world without feeling in a slump. Is there anything that can be done? Has anyone else experienced this problem?
What am I? Your son/daughter? While I am fine with my parents giving me jobs and objectives in life, I am sick of being treated by a scrapegoat by everybody else. Everywhere I am it's always me that has to follow instructions when everybody else gets off free, the internet, school (not from teachers, students... I am not at school anymore by the way), outside, ANYWHERE. Can't you people do your own fucking tasks and do anything that you tell me to do on your own! Are you retarded or something? Here's something that I can tell you to do: Get a fucking life or if you don't want one, KILL YOURSELF! I am sorry for my rambling but do you hate it when you are treated like a child?
Hi everyone. I'm having a rough day. Sunday night I was at a festival for wine. I had about 4 glasses and was alright. When I got home and started feeling horrible. My hands went numb and we're contracted inwards. I couldn't feel my legs and my.breathkng was so heavy. I was able to go to sleep. Then monday morning it all started again. Arms numb and weak and hands contracting. Went to the ER. Had about 4 more of these episodes. Face went numb too during the 4th time. They were able to give me xanex and it calmed me down. The doctors all agree I was having panic attacks. I've always struggled with anxiety and take Prozac 40mgs. I don't have anything to take for if I'm having a panic attack because I usually don't get them. Idk what caused Sunday and Monday to happen but I keep thinking about it and it keeps trying to trigger my anxiety. My question is, is how do you feel after you have panic attacks. Are you anxious for a few days? I guess I'm scared that this is somehow oddly permanent. The doctor gave me a few xanex to take so I can sleep. I didn't sleep the night of the wine very good for obvious reasons ( alcohol). And last night in the hospital I kept tossing and turning. Do you think some of this is from lack of sleep. I know this is a long post and if I can provide anymore details let me know. I'm just having a hard time and am worried. Thanks.
So last year was my first year in college and I was really excited to experiment and have lots of sexual partners. However the first girl I hook up with says we have to date to have sex. In short, what started as a shallow arrangement has turned into 9 months of knowing a legitimately cool person. Sex completely aside, our relationship is good. She is passionate about a lot of stuff and very independent. We both lead our own lives but support each other's endeavors. The type of stuff which you would marry someone over. However I got roped into this way before I stopped experimenting. During my recent family reunion everyone is telling me that sophomore year is really fun and to not waste it. This seems like the perfect time to come out of a relationship and experience the hook up culture of college. I could join a particularly diverse fraternity and really go for it. So my question is compounded. First, is sophomore and junior year in college really one of a kind in terms of hookup culture? And if so, is it worth it to sacrifice this opportunity to build a relationship with an attractive, smart girl that I am confident would last a long time. She is also very traditional and has turned down my (early) requests to have an open relationship. I am also fairly confident I could build this good of a relationship with other fish in the sea but I just don't know. It feels way to early to decide if she's "the one", and I feel the time I have in college growing short. TLDR; college time is short, do I use it to build a relationship or experiment
I started off my day by missing a place shaving (annoying). I then struggled through my morning classes which are getting very difficult and tedious (Calculus and English). After a headache filled morning, I thought I could get a good lunch. School lunch was not that good. Next, I had Spanish and Physics. These were also painful and boring. After H period, I realized a job interview I had scheduled was today not tomorrow. I flew to the interview and was 30 minutes late. The questions were very awkward and random. I finished and was driving home when I noticed something wrong with my car. It vibrates when going up hill and accelerating! I just got it out of the shop last Thursday, and it is a very new car. I am now sitting at home complaining about my life to Reddit. I will go to bed and relive the day another 4 times before the weekend. I am questioning why in the world my life has been garbage recently. Thank you for listening to my rant.
I get so angry at myself for not being perfect/living up to expectations. Been struggling with depression, eating disorders and suicidal tendencies for years now. I hate myself because I'm not thin or pretty, which causes a lot anxiety that I always end up expressing in front of my parents. My mom freaks out whenever she hears me say "I'm fat" which is probably my fault because of all the shit I've put both my dad and her through. She screams that she is literally counting down the years to when I turn 18 and she can legally kick me out of the house. I know she probably doesn't mean this, but I end up shouting insults and obscenities back at her, in front of my dad and 12 year old brother. Needless to say, I always end up feeling like shit. I need advice on how to stop fucking everything up. HELP ME!
So I'm not exactly sure where to start with this so I'll just provide an example of how this is messing things up in my life. There's a girl who I'm friends with and I don't know how I feel about her. I kinda like her but I'm also not sure if I do. I've been single for a long time and I just don't know when I want an actual relationship now it seems like. Another thing you should know about me is I am really, really bad at dating and meeting people. I don't have a ton of friends and the friends I do have, most are guys. Which makes me wonder if I feel something for her because I actually do or because she is one of the few females I actually know on a personal level. Do I like this girl because I like her or do I just feel alone? If I had other choices would I pick them or would I pick her? I just don't really know if I feel like I want her because I have feelings for her or if I'm just wanting a hook up under the guise of emotions. How do I tell if I want her or someone else? This also applies to anyone else I meet in the future since I've been single for so long which is why I have put it as a personal issue as it has happened before as well. --- **tl;dr**: How do I tell if I actually have feelings for someone vs being lonely or thinking I do when I actually just want a hook up?
To celebrate the end of her masters semester, my girlfriend went to a friends for a party and whilst incredibly drunk (shes been in bed since Tuesday morning (Party was Monday) so she must have been bad) she kissed a university friend that seems to be one of her closest friends at uni. They later went to bed and woke up still drunk the next day then kissed and he licked her out whilst drinking still. What made it worst is that even when she woke up the next day, she stayed in his bed, albeit still drunk but she did turn down sex when he said he wanted to. I'm in a shitty place in life at the moment and really don't know what to do. Please help Edit: She told me by coming out clean and telling me today so we could talk on skype rather than calling me at work Another edit: we are long distance so only see each other every few weeks. I think she struggles not seeing me as much as we could before she started uni --- **tl;dr**: Girlfriend drunkenly cheated with a uni friend
I lost three of my best friends within two months, I lost the first one cuz I we didn’t like the same anime and he hates me for it, second one is becuase I liked her, and I asked her out and she said “I don’t know” and since that we’ve barely talked, when we do she just tells me to go away, the last one I lost, was my my fault becuase I got sad, and she just blew up on me for it, I could explain but I don’t feel like it, if anyone wants to know in the comments I guess I’ll type it out. I put this here becuase I just wanted someone to talk or let this out.
I avoided having a girlfriend for years because of this, but I finally felt ready and have been with someone for 8 months. It seems to me though like the moment I'm in a relationship no one wants to let me enjoy it. All the sudden people I know start flirting with her, saying things like "why are you even with him", and just general stuff to make it sound like I'm not good enough to have a girlfriend. Is this something a lot guys face? I've taken lots of time to work on myself as a person and think I have a lot to offer. I'm generally considered attractive, work two jobs (one of them being my own business), play in a weekly gigging band, and have a lot of friends. I know I'm not perfect though. I'm short and bald and kinda shitty at conversation which can make me come off as timid. But we're all human, and I don't know why people seem to think I don't deserve a girlfriend. &#x200B; \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : \*\*Seems like everyone prone to deny the man's worth\*\*.
I have anger issues, that's a given now. However, it tends to be with loved ones. There's been a few times where they've gotten the better of me. I might have squeezed an ex's wrist too hard, or just screamed and banged a table in rage in audible distance of a family member. Today I loomed over my sister glaring at her in rage because of something she said, and her husband told me I had to calm down. I didn't think it was aggressive at the time, but now I see it was. I struggle to forgive myself for these actions because I'm scared they'll happen again, and I need to find a way to control them. I'm terrified one day I'll strike someone close to me in a rage.
So i am at my girlfriends house rn.(2 years together)We were suppoused to have a party and get drinks that kind of party. And we also were with some common friends. And i swear to fucking god i was ignored all the time. I mean like the whole fucking night. Only thing i was asked was to change the music volume. And if i was okay. But every damn time i said no i wasnt they just ignored me,as if i was there just as a decoration. Thing is though i always feel like this and she always ignores my need for attention as ive been screwed over multiple times and i want to know that she still loves me. But i just feel im only as a replacement. Someone to make out with when she feels like it. Someone who is there for every single one of her needs but never for my own. I just feel useless. Like i dont matter. As if im not important to her. She s sleeping rn but i feel like bursting into tears and cant sleep. What can i do??
I have a pretty small family. My parents, brother and I have been living in the US for 7 years now. The rest of our family are in Ukraine (my dad's mother, father and a few cousins) and Israel (my mom's mother and brother). Since the flight to here is very expensive and is 12+ hours, my grandma's usually visit once 2-3 years but stay for 2-3 months. Every time they visit, at first they like it here - we have a big house, 2 cute dogs, we live in a very beautiful place by a forest... - but then they start talking about how much they want to go back. They don't say it to my parents but they say it to me (I'm pretty close with my grandmas, like a friend). I thought that maybe they are bored, but my Israeli grandma for example browses the internet/cooks most of the day and she can do exactly the same thing here. I get that they are away from their friends, but I feel very hurt that they can't cope a 2-3 months away from them for their closest family which is us?.. I am a university student and I also come to visit my family in the summer and don't see my friends and boyfriend for a while but it's worth it because I miss my parents and brother. Any advice or thoughts? --- **tl;dr**: My small family lives in the US, grandma's from overseas both seem to hate visiting us for longer than a week. They are pretty much my entire extended family
I seriously can't do it. If i put in my 2 week notice I'll have to work 2 jobs at the same time and that might tire me out so much that Ill end up not wanting to leave my office job to go back to manual labor.. I don't care for the refrence from my office job they wouldn't have anything good to say about me anyways. The only thing I'm worried about is my manager sending me death threats because once i quit that department is going to fall behind and take weeks to fully replace me.. but i can't take the stress of it being my last 2 weeks and have them all know it's my last 2 weeks and ridicule my decision and make me out to look crazy for going back to my old job i use to tell them was a shit show.. So..when i end up walking into my bosses office some day soon and telling him i got another job and need to quit I'm sure once my manager gets word of that he's going to send me messages giving me a piece of his mind I'm sure he'll call me a coward and threaten if he ever sees me on the streets he'll kick my ass.. What exactly should i do? It's their fault for firing everyone and putting to much responsibly on me.. I'm being over worked and treated like I'm autistic, ridiculed, i can't even be myself at work without being the butt end of every joke
he visited me last night. i’m sure of it. i was thinking of him all day and i’ve been really sad about it lately. just super regretful that i never got closer to him. i was driving to my voice lesson on the verge of tears because the two year anniversary is coming up. using by sorority noise came on and i skipped it because that song reminds me a lot of him. then literally three songs later it came back on. the playlist i was listening too has like 600 songs and never repeats songs that close together. i parked my car and listened to the rest of the song and cried. then i felt this warm comforting feeling. it felt like a hug. i cried even harder. he was known for his hugs. something in me knew it was him. he was there with me and i’m so so so grateful. i feel so much relief.
Hey everyone, &amp;#x200B; So to put more context into this, i'm a really calm person when just talking to people, socializing whatsoever. Alot of people call me calm, i like my life the calm way. I also have a really high limit of things that i can take before getting mad. The problem here is that when it goes over my limit i go from calm to EXTREMELY mad in a second. When this happens , it feels like my blood is going 20 times faster through my body, it feels like i have 10 times more power and i don't have any control over my body. I have never hurt anyone physically but i'm afraid i might do it in the future and i don't know what to do about it. I always learned myself to keep calm in any situation ( i got raised in a violent home and saw that it's never good to be violent) and i always just had that little positive in me to JUST stop but it's always on the border of almost doing something. &amp;#x200B; I am really afraid, of myself. I don't want to hurt anyone, this doesn't feel like me, i feel like i'm a whole different person when this happens because normally i'm always calm. I don't know if anyone is going to able to help, but i wanted to vent somewhere and i think this was the place for that.
My bunny Caramel passed away at the vet on Friday night and I’m struggling to accept my new reality without him. He was there because of stomach issues (which he has had before and survived) but the procedure went wrong and he peacefully passed under anesthesia. Because he had had these issues before and survived, I didn’t think to say a proper goodbye to him at the vet, or even make the last day I spent with him special. He had been with me for over ten years and was the sweetest most affectionate bunny I’ve ever met, always running up to me when I called him and licking my hands. The guilt and grief are so intense, I can’t believe he isn’t here anymore.
We're in the process of remodeling our house and there's so much to do. We've contacted so many contractors for various jobs, I cant even count. It's an annoying process in itself because those not interested in the job never answer/call back. But this contractor takes the crown. He was weird in his shop, acting all awkward after talking very nicely to a female customer. Maybe he didn't like my SO and me? My SO is blonde and I'm "mildly" ethnic. Most people can't put me anywhere but most think I'm not a native. We live in a very culturally diverse region, with tons of international firms. We even have an international school in our 40 000 people town! I don't think this was the issue. But it's lingering in the back of my head... What's weird, he agreed on an appointment right before his vacation. He even promised us to get back to us as soon as he got back. It was awkward appointment to say the least. He spotted a sticker on the windows from a different contractor and grunted why we didn't have them to do the job. Well, they didn't offer what we wanted. It has been weeks. I called to ask and he was even ruder than before. He wouldn't make an offer. He made us think he was interested. It's really okay if you're not interested in this job - it's nothing big and schedules are tight. We know that! But why are you bitching about it like it's personal? I'm a bit sensitive when it comes to things like these. But even others are weirded out but this. I feel like a second class customer. Gah, I'm so angry.
Not a severe problem, but I tend to accumulate anger overtime. For instance, I lost $5 on my way home, I got slightly upset. My UberEats order is wrong, I got slightly upset. My grocery store closed an hour early without notice, I got slightly upset. And those uncomfortable angry feelings builds up and make me even more upset. However, my anger can be relieved while I get "compensated" or "revenge". For instance, I picked up $5 by my door, I got relieved. I request a refund from UberEats and approved, I got relieved. I leave a bad review for the store, I got relieved. But if there is nowhere or nobody for me to "blow" my anger to, I will start to feel really uncomfortable with a chance to totally blow up. For instance, I blew up on a fake deaf beggar before. What's wrong with me?
Comcast Sent Me a nice little email about copyright infridgement, They Told me That The mod i made for a Game (that i bought, shogun 2 to be exact) was copyright infrigement. the First time I stop seeding the torrent. However, The next day I got another Nice email from Comcast, saying the same exact thing, this time i deleted the torrent from all file sharing sites and anywhere else the torrent was. TODAY, I GOT ANOTHER NICE EMAIL FROM COMCAST, SAYING THE SAME SHIT, SAME REASON. THIS TIME I ASK COMCAST WHO SENT THEM THE NOTFICATION. "SEGA AND/OR THEIR AFFILIATES". I CHECK EVERYTHING, NOT ONE BYTE OF MY MOD IS AVAILABLE ON THE WEB. SO, FUCK. YOU. SEGA.
I wish he could have known how much I'd miss him. I'm having such a hard time right now, and I know he would have all the answers and help me in a heartbeat. I can't help but feel so hurt that he would leave me on purpose. I know he wasn't in his right mind towards the end, but it feels so bad knowing that he did this intentionally. I wish I could call him and cry. I'm having so much trouble with money and my mental health, and I just need him to tell me to hang on and keep going. He didn't hang on and keep going? Hypocrite lol. Fuck.
Not sure if this should even be on the /depression part but I do started to feel anxiety since yesterday about a fear of losing interest in the things I love the most, mostly music, my favorite artists ever, I listen to them and feel nothing then I get this really really dark feeling in me, feeling suicidal although inside my mind I know I love them but anxiety or whatever it is make me feel weird all the time. It's as though I'm losing life inside of me, it's like being a robot and I think it's related to school, and the amount of projects I have to juggle with. I don't know how to fix that, how to get better, it's really tiring
I've been playing it and while it's fun, it's also sending my anxiety for a loop. I was having trouble with a stealth part so I took a "break" to explore some new areas. Immediately ran into a guardian. Decided to just go for the tower to get the regional map, ran into a **fucking mini boss**. Every time they appear I go full into fight or flight mode and it's been physically painful to play at times. I've had the fight or flight response to video games before but never this frequently because usually there's quiet areas between enemies. I'm just so stressed out guys, is anyone else finding this?
I was with a woman for almost 3 years. Last month I found out(ironically on here) that she had been cheating on me for essentially our entire relationship. We lived together, laughed together, cried together. I was far from perfect. I didn't deserve this however. I haven't even stopped talking to her. I find myself second guessing normal interactions and I feel like I won't be any good for a woman for a considerable amount of time at this rate. I don't know whats proper to keep with me and what to leave behind. Any advice on how to start regaining confidence and the first steps on trusting someone else? TLDR found out my fiance was unfaithful through Reddit, advice on confidence and trust.
I absolutely love the holidays, but omg, it was so much easier before I had a long-term partner. &#x200B; My parents are great -- super supportive, want to help in any and every way, and also, love the holidays. While verbally, my parents (or, my dad, anyway) they state that we should split holidays between my parents and hers, the discussions of "No stress! Do whatever you want for the holidays!" spikes my anxiety in really hard and fast ways. When I told my mom I was going to my partner's parent's place for thanksgiving last year (even while my folks had drilled into me that I was TOTALLY OK GOING), she didn't talk to me for a few days, and when she did, she sobbed. For reference, I was in my mid-20's, and had spent every thanksgiving at home. &#x200B; Now my partner and I have moved into our own place, away from both of our families (not that we lived close to either of them to begin with), and my dad keeps offering to bring up holiday decorations, and then couching it with "hey, no problem, no stress! we know that \[partner\] might not want it!" even after I tell him multiple times that \*I\* want the stuff. &#x200B; TL;DR I just got off the phone with my dad about holiday stuff and I'm so stressed and anxious that I nearly barfed.
I don’t know what to do. My ex killed herself 6/27, as far as I know it was after we fought, and I was the last person to talk to her. It’s so hard. I don’t know what to feel. I feel like I am responsible for this beautiful young woman’s death. It’s so hard to deal with all these feelings. She had such a big smile that would light up the room and to know that no one will see that anymore... Sorry this is really rambly but I haven’t had anyone to really share everything with. I just want the world to make sense again, because nothing seems right anymore. How can I keep going knowing that this person is gone. Knowing that my actions helped drive this. Fuck
I hope this is the right place to post this. If not, please point me in the right direction. &amp;#x200B; I work in a small office with 3 other people. 2 desks (one being mine) face the window. My coworker noticed a fox walking in our parking lot and mentioned it, so we all kinda stood up to check it out. The little guy gets closer and we can see that he is obviously very hurt, to the point where we weren't sure how he was still walking. We later found out he was already hit by a car. We called animal control but got the voicemail so we called 911. Animal control showed up right away but when he got out he scared the fox and he ran in the street and got hit by a car again. That's when the cop showed up. They moved him out of the road but he was so injured that the cop shot him. I know he is not in pain and is out of his misery now, and he would've been put down anyways, but I can't help but want to cry for the little guy. I love animals too much. I'm also not a fan of gun and wasn't expecting it so hearing the gunshot was upsetting too.
Help me (throwaway). I don’t want to be this way. Last week was the breaking point. I got so mad at my SO I started destroying everything. I nearly hit her until I stopped myself and realized what I had done. It killed me to see the look on her face and to see all the shit that I broke there were holes in the walls and my hands are still messed up from that. She forgave me but I decided that I wasn’t good for her. I broke things off. I’ve tried anger therapy before but it never fully stuck. I also am trying to be a better person in general. There is a part of me deep inside that’s truly evil but I’m trying to be nice and wholesome to everyone. Not an excuse but I suspect it’s due to early childhood trauma. Where do I start? I’m tired of hurting others and the horrible guilt afterwards.
More of an off my chest post than anything else but here goes. So, 2020 in Feb I lost my mum unexpectedly to sudden cardiac arrest. Fast forward to December 2020, dad had a fall and it was initially suspected that he had had a stroke. After some fast scans it became apparent he had a mass on his brain and also in his lungs. Dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung and brain cancer the week before christmas 2020. There was a chance for palliative treatment however within a short few weeks dad had rapidly lost weight, mobility and his planned palliative treatment was called off. Dad passed on the 3rd of March this year. This is the first christmas without mum and dad. I have a partner and her family is and has been brilliant throughout and this year I will be spending my christmas with them which will be nice, but. its just not the same? Of course im thankful and greatful to have someone to spend my festive period with but it kills without my parents. I can remember christmas 2019 - just mum, dad and myself and I could have never imagined that 2 years down the line, this is where I am. The year has been ok, i'm a relatively stable dude and everyone keeps saying how strong I have been and how well i'm doing and I dont disagree, i've amazed myself and i'm proud as im sure mum and dad would be. Holidays are hella hard.
I (f41) want to preface this by saying I loved my mother in law. She was one of the most loving, selfless, curious, and creative people I've ever known. Without her influence, our lives would be very different. I miss her everyday. My husband (m41) lost his mom last spring. It happened really quickly. It's still a shock. This is our 2nd Mother's Day without her. Most years my husband will surprise me with a beautiful meal, flowers, and a small gift. Nothing extravagant, just something to say, "Hey, thanks for pushing a tiny human out of your body." This year, he's hardly talked to me about Mother's Day. No gift, no meal, no flowers. I know he's hurting and I feel incredibly selfish for feeling forgotten about. Is this going to be our norm now? Does Mother's day disappear for your wife when you lose your mom?
So much loss in such a short period. I miss my friend, I miss my grandmother, and most of all I miss my father. I feel grateful that my dad taught me to practice gratitude in my life; grateful that he was conscious in the hospital enough time for me to spend a little time with him. Grateful that I had him at all. Grateful that I don’t believe he was in pain at the end. Every day is different. Sometimes images of him in the hospital appear in my mind and it’s very upsetting. I feel guilty that we didn’t have a service but I know it was what he would have wanted because covid. I feel guilty that I didn’t stop him from going to the dinner where he caught it. I feel angry all time. I hate the nurses who didn’t treat him with enough compassion, the coworkers who acted like the stress of work was anywhere near comparable to the stress of loss. Where do we go from here? I am not hung up on possessions - you are beyond the physical now. I don’t want any of my own much anymore - where would they go when I’m gone. I hate that you’ll never meet the person I fall in love with. I feel robbed. Today is easier than two weeks ago but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. At best it’s distraction from the gap you’ve left. Why did it have to turn out this way? In my dream you said the love reaches you and I love you everyday so much.
Let's just say i cant stop overthinking and i am upset over every little thing. In fact, i am so upset at times that I feel like i am making the people around me upset too because of my emotions. I feel like an emotional mess, a baggage. I am upset about every little thing and I dont remember not overthinking about irrelevant things. I am so scared of the future, I am scared of how much power everything has on me. I genuinely just want to be happy, i ask for nothing more. I am not perfect but my superpower was my positivity, my happiness. I'm losing all of it, all of it. I dont know what it feels like to truly be happy. The sadness is consuming me and its consuming everyone else around me too.
Over half of my life, I've had periods of time where my anxiety stops me from speaking a word to strangers, and in those times I've at least been able to chat and have fun with people online. Some years back, even that got hard for me, and I've withdrawn from more gaming communities than I'd like to admit because the social aspect made me uncomfortable and would drain all my energy. About a year ago, I started playing Heroes of the Storm with my boyfriend and sometimes online friends from other past communities. He's unable to play right now despite wanting to, and the others are busy elsewhere, so I rarely catch them nowadays. This means I mostly play alone. In this game, I wasn't fond of player vs player because I would feel embarassed when doing stupid things or getting myself killed. But I like that game mode, and it's what the game was made for, so I've done my best to play it anyway. I'm finally starting to feel confident about it and can enjoy it properly, of course except when I get placed in group with toxic players 😌 Buuuut to minimize that problem, and also because playing alone is starting to feel lonely, I went ahead and joined a community with focus on being friendly. This is the first time, I believe, I've gone out of my way to meet strangers with the hopes of making new friends, and I'm proud of myself for having the guts to do it!
It's Friday night. Got home from rehearsal for a show I'm going to be in at my high school. My friends told they're getting online on Xbox. Awesome, after a long stressful week including two stress-induced nosebleeds, two EOCs (End of Course Exams, basically the big kid version of the *STAAR test), and a whole lit if of other bull crap, this is what I need, some down time on Xbox with my buddies. But my older brother is on, he's playing with friends. I am so God damn tired. Not because I'm sleep, because I'm so God damn worn out from the past few fucking weeks. I'm losing my patience by the minute and it's not getting better. All I wanted to do was play video games with my buddies and act like everything is alright and back to normal. I just want this play to go smoothly. I just want the Blues to beat the Predators. I just want to do well on my English project. I just want to get my Geography, Biology, and Spanish grades up. I just wanna find a day to go on that date I asked a girl out on. I just want my brother to stop blaring his music loudly in the car on the way home when I just want to sit there and tell myself that even though I believe I'm seem as a nuisance it'll be okay, not listen to your loud, annoying music and your terrible job at singing it. I don't want sleep. I just. Want. A fucking. Break... But I can't get one. Meanwhile, my parents are in Mexico on vacation and my homophobic, extremely right-winged grandmother who can barely hear (still love her to death, she's just got very out-dated views) as watching over my brother and I until they get back.
Honestly I’m feeling really lonely. I never had many friends and it takes me a long time to make them. I haven’t joined a Facebook group or met any other widows except for this one military organization that connected me with one. She has been nice but I am lacking a community outside of this one. Can you guys share your experiences doing support groups, widow retreats, social groups, etc? Anything that helped you meet more widows? I’m in my early twenties and feeling low honesty I just need more of a community but I’m a little nervous about getting involved.
I don't have any features that ake me beautiful, my face is quite asymmetric, my head is also in a very asymmetric shape, my body is quite average, i dont have belly fat but my thighs are really big, i have stretch marks all over my legs and aroung the place where my ribcage is. I hate that all the guys go after the pretty popular girl, she's really obnoxious but they all like her because she always ''sHowS hEr cURveS'', its not my fault my mother doesn't allow me to wear clothes that are a little more showing. And the worst part is that I'm in 8th grade...
I feel like there's something inside of me that has completely taken over my life. As self aware as I believe myself to be, I am an extremely emotional person who tends to react rather than absorb and assess the situation and respond accordingly with the consideration of long term effects. I completely neglect that process and tend to overreact. I currently work in customer service and for a brief time I was completely empathetic and calm. Fast forward to no more than a month and I'm already dreading the role. I lost patience with customers easily and every call that comes through , I want to end as quickly as possible and that more often than not means not being empathic and understanding. I unnecessarily engage with customers. Just wondering how others in similar situations cope?
My girlfriend (18 f) and I (19 m) have been together for almost a year now, having gotten together at the end of high school. Now the issues surrounding distance (different universities) and a fear of commitment are making the both of us have doubts. Also included, she is profound health issues, and while I will not be going into specifics to preserve identities. The health issues are debilitating, potentially incurable, and terrifying to me. I will admit I am afraid to one day wake up with regret. I love her now but I don't want to hurt her later. Is there anything I can do, or any resources that might be helpful? --- **tl;dr**: Me (19m) and gf (18f) are in a previously happy relationship that now has doubts. What are some options I have?
Michael, Amanda, and myself. The three of us started working here two years ago. Michael and Amanda dated for awhile then he dumped her. It hurt her. Fast forward a year (now), Amanda and I begin this whirlwind romance. She becomes my first. We are very into each other. I fell *really* fucking hard. Michael catches wind of this. Decides he wants her back and tells her he's sorry for being so bad to her. She's upset and feels guilty about us, but we just keep seeing each other privately. She calls it off eventually. Decided she still has feelings for him but doesn't know if she can forgive him. Doesn't want to talk to me anymore and ignores me. I know they're probably getting back together at some point. I'm shattered. So, tomorrow: all three of us have to work together to set up the store's ad. I'm so anxious and nervous about being around them during the shift and potentially seeing them so chummy with one another and possibly taking their lunches together, etc. How do I maintain myself? I don't even want to go to work. I am so nervous. It feels like there's a hole in my stomach and my heart is bleeding out of my chest. It's hard to breathe. Any ideas? I'm desperate.
My first Christmas in 17 years without my cat. She was my best friend, followed me everywhere, and loved to dive into a huge pile of toys and get a new collar on Christmas morning. We had to put her to sleep last Friday, due to extreme health decline. I greet her box of ashes every morning, night, and any spare moment in between, because I can’t believe she’s gone. I still cry every day, and it’s very hard to feel any good feelings knowing she isn’t here. I know lots of people are struggling around the holidays without their beloved pets, and I just wanted to say I’m sorry and extend love to everyone having a rough time. ❤️
Content Warning: emetophobia/illness My boyfriend and I are sick, from the cesspool of a high school we go to. I have a huge phobia of being sick, and He does too. Right now, he says he's fine and I believe him but last night when he was okay he ended up getting sick very early in the morning. I'm really worried about him and I don't want this to happen to him again. I have the same thing as him and I feel like worrying this much is making me feel even worse, and I've not been in good shape to begin with. I can't be with him either and that's making me feel worse too. I feel really alone and scared and I don't know how to fix things.
I am terrible socially, to the point where I hide in my room in my pyjamas from all humans except close family. I leave the house the odd time to grab snacks and that’s it. I freak out before, during and after every social situation. I start to panic uncontrollably and have to excuse myself when this happens. I hide from the freaking postman when they knock on the door. I once even explained to my brother what pads were so he could buy them for me because I was too scared to do it. He was 11, This is a huge issue and I hate living like this, but I’m scared changes and risks. Plus seeing a doctor about it means being social.
It's so slow here I'm just sitting in a room by myself. I don't know what I can do to make money. I'm not making it here and all of the jobs that pay the same or better require a degree which I can't go get. I'm behind on payments, my girlfriend I live with thinks we're doing better money wise than we are and she can't find a job. Plus I'm the only one with a car and my hours vary so that just makes it even harder to find a job. I just don't know what to do. I love her so much and I don't want money to affect our relationship at all. I'm normally so happy and care free when I'm with her but it's getting to me and I can't put up that facade much longer. I scored a 31 on my ACT in high school without studying, so I know I'm smart I just can't do school and I don't know what I can do. I feel like I'm such wasted potential.
I have this fear of accidentally offending people. Like I used to sometimes say things which are misinterpreted as offensive. For example, I may ask questions which are interpreted as nosey by the other person and then I ask these questions too much so the other person will somewhat dislike me. I am diagnosed with anxiety and my psychiatrist said I have "some traits of an Aspie". She said that my fear of accidentally offending people is not "what most people think like" and this constant fear may be off-putting to some people. I don't know... I also sometimes feel like I can't trust anyone with my secrets. I know that some of the teachers at my school have hinted that I have an anxiety disorder out of concern but I can't help but stay secretive about everything due to the fear of being blacklisted and betrayed. Even now, I am scared that someone will find this thread and identify who I am despite that I know that this is statistically improbable.
Hey all, I have set up a **free** online group to support people like us with problems with anger. The next meeting will be on **Tuesday November 17th at 1900 Central European Time**. If you would like to join then please send me a message so I can send the Google Meet link for the meeting. The group is there to provide support by creating a safe and non-judgemental space for us to talk about our issues with anger, offer each other empathy and offer strategies to help us with anger. There is no pressure to share so if you want to come along and listen then that's also fine. I've had a few messages from people wanting to join our last meetings but didn't come along in the end. If you are one of those people and you want to try again then don't worry about sending me another message I know this stuff can sometimes be difficult to talk about or maybe you ended up being busy.
We've been together so long and we're best friends. We both don't have many other friends outside our relationship, so maybe that's part of what is keeping us together. When it comes to humor, taste in media, core values, views on religion, goals- we mesh perfectly. But he has explosive anger that makes me close up, which in turn makes him more angry. When there's disagreement, I still treat the person I love as kindly as I can. But he treats me so coldly that I feel so alone when we're fighting. After the argument he is remorseful, but that insecurity, knowing that if he gets upset again he will turn on me, keeps me worried. I've always been a bit of an outcast, and I thought I had finally found someone to be partners in life with. He tells me he loves me, regrets every mean thing he says, and that the anger is something he's working on. I know I'm not perfect, but am I so bad that these rages are appropriate? Is this all my fault? **tl;dr: long-term bf and I are struggling. is it possible for someone to grow/mature at this age and stop these fits of anger -more force to their movements, yelling, etc.?**
Hey r/relationships, I just wanted to get other people's perspective on this situation. I broke up with my ex, Kyle of 1 year, months ago, because I knew it wasn't going to work out. That being said, I started dating someone months later, whom, I'm still with at the moment. But, I feel odd because in a way, I'm happy for Kyle since he's a wonderful person, and he can spend his life with someone who is right for him. But I feel weird that he's with someone else, even though I was the one who broke up with Kyle and I'm with another person. Is this a normal feeling? --- **tl;dr**: Broke up with ex, and now seeing someone else. Found out that ex is dating again, and I feel happy for him, but weird at the same time. Is this a normal feeling?
I had a really rough morning. I broke down in front of a student FNP trying to articulate my recent struggles with anxiety. I’d seen the doctor in order to talk about foot pain making it difficult to exercise and ended up finding out I have scary high blood pressure for a 26yo due to stress and that I seriously need to talk to someone about my mounting anxiety. I worry constantly. I can’t give myself the grace to relax. I have panic attacks. And right now instead of facing those facts with kindness, I feel ashamed to be taking a step backwards and starting at square one with medication and therapy after having felt “better” for nearly six years. I wish I was posting my first Reddit on #FoodPorn or #rarepuppers but I guess I was hoping to find some sense of community here. Or at least to know I’m not alone in this.
I am a 17-year-old biological male, but female in gender (MtF trans), I have not gone through any hormones so I'm all testosterone. I am, and I can say this confidently, a nice person. I try my best to be kind to everyone and be as polite as possible to people who annoy me or irritate me. I've never yelled at anyone for being irritated or anything like that. But I have this almost insane part of me that is extremely violent. When I'm by myself I get angry really easily. Like if I'm having trouble with homework, a video game, anything really, I get so mad I start hitting myself in the side of the head as hard as I can for a good minute. And then people who are just mean to me just to be fucking assholes really get me going. And then I get *really* violent thoughts. I think about punching them, ground and pounding their face, slamming their head on the concrete. Sometimes it gets really bad, like I want to stab them, slit their throat, or press my thumbs into their eyes. It scares the shit outta me. I'm afraid that one day I might do something stupid when I get angry at someone. But on one would expect it because I really try my best to nice to everyone. I really love people in general. But I have this crazy violence in me that scares me.
Ironic as that sounds, I’m sick of my anger. It always comes out when I think things over and think “Maybe I could’ve done this differently”, and then it grows into more anger for not doing that. I fucking hate it when it comes back after the fact, and that funnily enough makes it even worse. I apologized to some of my friends recently for acting stupid (because of my fucking anger), and then the angry side of me invades my fucking subconscious telling me that I shouldn’t have apologized to them because they didn’t deserve it and they’re assholes. No you fuck. YOU’RE THE FUCKING ASSHOLE!!! You keep flooding my mind with doubt and hate, and I’m fucking fed up with it!!! I hate you! I wish you would fuck off and die, because I’m so fed up with you making my life worse!! Fuck you! I wish you would go away, but you never do! I’m so sick of this happening. Does anyone know how to make this shit stop happening in my fucking head? I’m tired of it making me so damn indecisive. I want it to go away once and for all.
When I'm angry or something of minor inconvenience happens I have this urge to hit people. Since past three weeks when mom did something dumb like she accidentally pushed my laptop. I slapped her on her leg. It happened so fast, I couldn't even control it, like a reflex. This happened more than once. As a child I've seen my father hit my mom countless times, my sister has uncontrollable anger she throws stuff at walls and I'm doing the same. Sometimes I hit myself on forehead if can't find a way to express anger. I'm 22 M and scared because I'm afraid that I might do the same to my girlfriend, or in future to my own family or ruin my relationship with my family. My mom was really mad at me and I'm ashamed of my actions, I apologized to her and she said angrily, "don't lay a hand on me ever again". Today I was really mad at my cat that I was clenching my jaw. My cat loves me than any of the family member. I felt how much angry I was on her, just because she rubbed her nose on my fingers. How do I stop this? I don't like this version of me causing violence within myself and to others.
A year ago today, I lost my mother suddenly from congenital heart failure. I also experienced the death of both my grandmothers, my last remaining grandparents. It’s no easier than it was a year ago but I’ve gown capacity to love and enjoy life. It may seem shallow but I’ve found it remarkably grounding. Khalil Gibran said it well in his poem “On Love and Sorrow”… The deeper that sorrow carves into your being,the more joy you can contain. Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven? And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives? When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
I (18F) got taken off the mini pill 2 months ago because it was causing me to bleed every week. I’ve been on nothing since then just taking the occasional morning after pill if needed. My periods have recently only lasted 4 or 3 days and I’ve had major cramps in my back and stomach and mostly only on one side as if I had a constant stitch. I called my doctor she said she sounds like a miscarriage or like my body just having messy periods. I took a pregnancy test it came back negative I don’t want kids but I’m just confused as to what happened?
God damnit the last day before my vacation and every one of my clients break their shit. Can you give me one fucking peaceful day? I swear to god IT can be so infuriating, especially when your customer base are all morons who can't even function like normal human beings. You make me so angry you stupid shit heads! How the fuck do you feed yourselves if the simplist things are this difficult for you to grasp? You want stuff to work better? PAY THE MONEY TO UPGRADE THAT 20 YEAR OLD SHIT! I can't keep putting a bandaid on a gaping wound everytime it goes down! You do realize putting "ASAP this! ASAP that!" at the end of your ticket doesn't make me work faster, in fact it annoys the ever living shit out of me to the point where I'll make you wait longer! You think you can treat us all like shit because your company pays us, but you have no idea what we do to keep you running. Such ungrateful, disrespectful fucks.
I met "Ally" during last school year, and she's been my best friend at school since then. I feel like we tell each other everything, from crushes to family issues to just how we've been feeling. She had told me that she was seeing a therapist, but she didn't say what for and I thought it would be nosey to ask. But I've given her all my secrets, so when I saw that she posted on social media saying that she's two months clean from self harm, and that was first time I heard about it, I was a bit hurt. I realize it's not about me, though, and I realize that. I'm just worried about her, obviously. Should I talk to her about it, or should I just let it go? --- **tl;dr**: My friend Ally is like a sister to me, and we tell each other everything... or so I thought. She posted that she is two months clean from self-harm, and I've known her a lot longer than that but she never told me. What should I do?
13 days ago on of my oldest friends passed. 6 days ago a close friend died of liver failure. 2 days later my grandfather died after a prolonged struggle. That leaves me, withdrawn and alone. I'm scared, spiraling, and bitter. My public persona hasn't changed, the brave face, making jokes; I am dying inside. I am drinking myself to sleep, battling the urge to go out, get on it, and fucking lose it. I don't know what to do, I just want to be held. I'm so sad. I want to cry but there is nothing left. I'm a shell of a man. I want to reach out but the thought of it makes me sick. I'm going to councilling but I'm skeptical. I want to eat but I can't. I'm really struggling and I don't know what to do.
I feel so guilty for not being happy. I should, I know, but all that I can think about is death. I'm a coward, I've always been one. I don't want to fight anymore. I'm constantly chasing people and places that don't exist. I feel empty, a piece of me is missing, I know it, but what can it be? I just want to drown in my dreams, sleep, never wake up. I'm lonely in my mind since they're gone. I don't have as much imagination, I guess, and the only place I feel like I could ever be happy in is that forest I saw in a dream, on a cliff, lying in grass and flowers for a while And jumping off of it. I tell myself that I made progress, but it doesn't seem that obvious to others. I guess I didn't make that much progress. I am in a good family, a stable financial situation, I see therapists often, take my meds, but I cannot get myself to stop wanting to hurt myself, cut myself, stab myself, kill myself I'm sick of life I don't even know why I'm writing this, I'm as useless as ever
So, I lived in the same house with my 2 best friends, his room was next to mine and he was one of the best people I could cross my way. We found him hanging in his closet next to his suicide note on April 24. I could never and cannot tell him how much I appreciated him, how important he was in the lives of some of us, he died believing he was a bad friend, thinking that nobody really loved him, man, thats tough. It has been almost six months and I have not been able to really talk to anyone about this, and that's really painful. That's why i'm here on reddit, just to puke off all this shit.
so i have a long history with this girl but i’ve liked her for like 3 years and she liked me at some point but it’s just never lined up right. i’ve asked her out like twice and she said no both times and i just can’t get over her. she was talking to this other guy so i distanced myself because it hurt seeing that and because i’m going away soon, i’ve been talking to her again and i still have feels and i found out she’s still talking to a different person which i’m not surprised nor did i have control over but it pains me to see
I'm 33years old, I grew up under the care of parents who didn't explicitly give me communication of their love for me. They did raised me with affection and a lot of concern, checked off all the boxes other than instils in me self esteem and accountability, however when it came to situations where I should've been held accountable my parents always made it out to be about 'bad company' or they'd get angry at other people. In my house anger and honesty isn't really practiced. Definitely not in a healthy way. Anger always comes out indirectly. Today I'm married and have never dealt with my anger, never been in fights, find confrontation very very hard, However now I get angry mostly at myself for not rectifying my issues early on when I was aware, but also at my parents and rest of my family. I also realise that when I get angry nothing gets resolved, my parents and me get into shouting matches. What is a good beginner's guide or pointers or resource to read more on to understand myself better and keep my anger in check?
To whatever cosmic force is currently getting its rocks off by tormenting my family, fuck you sideways with a running, unlubricated chainsaw. *My father has had cancer five times in seven years. *My Mother had to spend part of that time laid up due to a botched gallstone operation *My sister's relationship fell apart, a mere month before she was supposed to be married *My brother lost his job through no fault of his own *I broke my leg last year *I lost a great uncle I barely knew and my grandmother who had been a part of my life since I was born within two weeks of each other. All of these would make any other malevolent entity zip up their pants and move on to some other target. But no. It wasn't enough for you, whatever your true name may be. You just had to go for one more round. **And now my dad is in the hospital, recovering from a minor stroke** Now, you listen and you listen good. I'm going to find a way to get to you. I will find out who you are, and why you haven't moved on to tormenting people that deserve it. I will punch a hole through space/time if I have to, just so I can have the pleasure of beating you within an inch of your metaphysical life. **My Family is officially off-limits and if anything else happens to them this year, I will find you, and I will cut you.** TLDR: Bad stuff happens in droves to my family, and I want to punch something until the world makes sense again.
I dread the questions about suicide in my therapy sessions. Am I the only one? I myself am not suicidal but I do wish I was dead or miraculously died or something.Usually, my therapist asks me this question in the middle of the session but today she decided to ask at the end and I did my best to answer honestly. After she asked where I see myself 5 years from now and I said probably dead. I guess I should have lied. She then asked me about 5 times whether I had a plan or intent to harm myself and I just kept shaking my head no. It was almost like she didn't want me to leave her office. Once our session was over she asked if I wanted to talk about something else and kept trying to I guess make me admit I was suicidal. Then before she let me go she said that I could call her to schedule another appointment this week if I need to. Also, she's still a trainee so I feel like I might have scared her I don't know.
Hello I guess... I'm lonely and I have no friends in rl I didn't even meet a person my age since about 3 years. Of course I want to change it but every time I try to I get hit with anxiety like a train. So I'm watching on weekend's usually kdramas before I go to sleep and it kinda makes me forget about my life. Anyway I wish there would be someone who'd just take my hand and drag me to people It's very difficult when you live in a village and have no one to talk to also I'm very shy and can't really start conversations that's what I experienced are the most problematic things that keep you from making friends if u want you can add some more things that make it problematic to make friends.
Greetings. My (f48) sister (f46) lost her husband (46) suddenly and unexpectedly in October 2020 to natural causes. He left behind his parents, two siblings, two daughters (17 & 20) by previous marriage, and his and my sis’s son (6). Father’s Day is coming up and I don’t know how to ask her what she wants to do that day. When I asked earlier in the year she sarcastically said, “Jump off a bridge.” Her FIL has dementia. Our parents are living. What suggestions can you offer to help me support her at this trying time? How can I support my nephew? Should I back off?
I’m Muslim. Muslims don’t “date” per say, but we get to know one another with the intention of marriage off the bat. (I can answer any questions on that if there’s a need) Anyways, here's the situation: I work with a Muslim guy and over the past couple of months, I’ve developed a small crush on him. I get the feeling that he also might like me but he has never told me. We work for Muslims and there are no policies about marriages between coworkers being prohibited. However, I don’t think I can go up to him and ask him because we work together and if he declines I don’t know if I can go back to work and face that kind of rejection LOL. What do you guys think I should do in this situation? Help a sister out! **tl;dr: i'm a muslim girl and i want to know how to approach my muslim coworker without making it an awkward work environment**
I’ve been on 20mg of Lexapro for about a year now after a bit of a breakdown where, rather than having my usual situational anxiety, I started to have unprompted attacks for seemingly no reason. While those panic attacks seem to have mostly subsided (and even a lot of my situational/social anxiety revolving work and school), I’m still experiencing that almost crippling fear when I even THINK about crushes, relationships, dating, and emotional or physical intimacy. It’s the reason that at age 23 I’ve never been in a relationship, let alone hugged/held hands/kissed anyone, and as time goes on, I’m starting to see how much of a problem that is. It all sort of clicked when I had a friend ask me if I was asexual. I knew very well that I wasn’t, but I was undoubtedly being held back by my anxiety to the point where it clearly appeared as such. I’d previously gone on a date that was going okay, up until the moment when the person confessed they liked me, to which my body responded with bolting off to the bathroom five separate times to throw up. Recently, an old crush mentioned they would be coming into town and wants to meet up. While I agreed, I’ve felt nothing but pure, crippling anxiety ever since. How normal is it to have such severe anxiety surrounding physical and emotional intimacy? I want to be able to experience a relationship and all the physical aspects of it as well, but every time it becomes even CLOSE to a reality, my heart rate increases, I feel disgustingly nauseous, and of course there’s that classic anxiety-sense of impending doom. How on earth am I supposed to combat these sorts of mental/bodily reactions, since my meds clearly aren’t helping on this front?
I've been on anxiety medication for about 8 years now for GAD and SAD. In that time, I've been in and out of multiple therapists offices, all of whom floated other possible conditions - bipolar, ADD, depression, even Avoidant Personality (is that even a thing?) - none of whom offered any real definitive answers. Meanwhile, my meds were like a life preserver after my ship sunk - I was no longer actively drowning, but I also was not on my way to some beach in Hawaii. I was treading water. About a month ago, I got up the courage to talk to my GP about ADD meds. It made sense - I have a lot of the classic signs and my sister was diagnosed at an early age. He put me on medication and it has been absolutely eye opening. No, my personality didn't change overnight, nor am I downing pills left, right and center to read five books every night or something else equally ridiculous. Instead, suddenly, I'm not fighting my own brain all the damn time. And because of that, I'm not only functioning anymore. Even more importantly, my anxiety is more under control than ever because (some of) the things that feed my daily struggles were being exacerbated on by my untreated ADD. It's not perfect and no two of us are alike, and I know many people don't like medication as a treatment so this may not be the road for you, but comorbidity IS a thing. My two cents: until you treat the whole, it's very possible that you are fighting against yourself, unintentionally or not.
I don't know what to say. My wife used to encourage me to find support groups online to help with my depression. I never took her advice. I am so heartbroken I think I am going crazy. So I will try and take her advice now. She was my best friend, my confidant and emotional rock. We had such grand plans but those mean nothing now. I wake up every day hope that this is a dream. I don't know what to do. I lived only to make her happy. So what is the point now? All I can do is just wait until it's my time. I am just shouting in the void now to see if it will help some how. But I doubt it.
My friend committed suicide and it was really difficult for me. The hardest part was that although I was close with him I was way closer with his 2 best friends. I felt like I had nobody to talk to because I felt guilty whenever I tried to talk to the two people I wanted to. I ended up meeting this girl and she really helped me when I was feeling miserable. I felt way more comfortable talking about it with somebody that was outside of the situation and she listened extremely well. She quickly became one of my best friends and I literally would spend nearly 30 hours a week with her. Of course that inevitably led to me having a crush on her. I ended up asking her out and she said no. At the time I decided it wasn't a big deal, and for around a month it did work out. I still enjoyed her company and the reason I am attracted to her is because of how great of a friend she is. But now for a few months it's started eating at me. I'm not getting over the crush and whenever I'm around her I feel absolutely miserable. I know that our friendship is not healthy for me to stick around in and I need to end it but we're currently working on a project together for ~40 days yet. I'm not sure if telling her I don't want to spend time with her anymore is going to be the best decision when I still have to see her nearly every day. Tl;dr I'm going to end my friendship but I'm not sure if I should do it now or wait until the project is over.
I get it, my sister is beautiful, and successful, and is constantly working on herself to better her position in life, and you’re jealous. I think it’s super weird that you are SO invested in who your brother is in a relationship with, but I guess it would be important given the IMMENSE amount of financial support you require from him despite being well into your forties (and lookin like your in your 60s babe, it’s called moisturizer) and having many adult children and baby daddies you should be able to ask for help from. I know it must be hard living your sad day to day life living out of a hotel that your brother has to pay for because you’ve gotten evicted from yet another flea infested hovel with your aggressive dogs and usually AT LEAST one of your adult children who also look to my sisters fiancé (and I know it reeeaally gets your goat that he gave her that biiiig shiny ring when you can’t even get a guy to commit to a second date after he sees your unfiltered face, sober, and in the daylight) to bail them out both financially and legally. I love how you’ve decided to go after the person who has given you jobs, defended you against the rest of your family, and has never tried to stop your brother from supporting your loser ass. I hope you choke to death on one of your menthol cigarettes you disgusting piece of hood rat trash.
She was 16 and he was 20 when they got married. To keep it a secret, they went to a neighboring county to get married. Back then they put marriage licences in the paper, just as they do today and they figured that this way it wouldn't be in the local paper for the parents to see. BTW, they did not "have to get married" but she did have to be talked into it. And after the wedding, ... She went home to her parents house and the secret was kept for a little while. On the weekend that my grandparents were to be married, my grandfather showed up at the great-grandparents house only to find, as he said "everyone in the house was crying". A friend of the family happened to be in that neighboring county, read the paper and told their parents. After much weeping and wailing and cries of "he stole my baby!", the marriage was accepted and lasted, for them, a lifetime.
I just got some AMAZING news that is going to (hopefully) make my life so much better. But I'm feeling all the symptoms of my regular anxiety (foggy head, rapid heart rate, sweating, shaking, etc) but I'm really happy about the news. It doesn't feel real. I haven't had this feeling in a long time because my life has been pretty shit until now. I remember getting so excited about vacations or seeing friends and I would get this exact same way. Is it "happy anxiety"? Is that a thing? I'm also starting to have all the negatives sink in. Is this real, I have more responsibilities now, can I handle this, what if I screw up, etc. I feel like this is a dream. I'm never this happy so it must not be really happening. Same with any past times I've felt this way. Life can't be going this well for me. Something terrible is going to happen to counteract this. I'm trying to calm myself down so I'm not so excited. I know a lot of people feel this way, but usually when something really good happens to me, the more excited I am about the situation, the more likely something bad is going to happen to me later on or whatever is making me happy will be ruined. I can't be alone in this, right?
Hey guys, I’m a long time HA sufferer, I’m actually also a medical professional and I assure you that doesn’t make me any more rational in fact it probably makes me worse. Anyway, I don’t experience HA frequently just once every few years but when I do it completely ruins me for at least a week or two, I completely descend into non-functional panic. This time is was triggered by a phone call from my recent ex a few days ago. She was emotional about many non health related issues but one included a non healing mouth ulcer she needs to have biopsied. This combined with how overall emotional (even hysterical) she was made that phone call genuinely traumatic for me and I haven’t been the same since. It does, as usual, focus primarily on the health aspect. If the ulcer is not cancer then I will be able to resume my normal life again. Until then I am constantly panicking about it, even though we aren’t talking much. I know that a 30 year old who doesn’t smoke or drink is extremely unlikely to get such a thing, but subconsciously my brain has decided it’s cancer and I am having vivid visions of the terrible consequences. Not really sure why I’m posting. I’ve been through this 4-5 times now; each time the gap between events gets longer and sometimes I manage to skip what would normally be a trigger but it seems like sooner or later it gets its hooks into me and down I go. I just hope I get better with time, but most of all I just hope she’s ok.
I live in a shared house in the north west of the UK and there is about 6 of us (was 7). I used to be close to 3 of them, now 2. We lost James on Thursday morning to a fatal car crash at 10:20AM. At 12PM the police knocked on our door asking to get into his room, I asked the landlady for a spare key. I was initially worried but then work took my mind off it. Come to early Saturday morning my landlady said James was involved in an accident and was seriously hurt. Come to around 12:30PM she sent me a local online newspaper article which confirmed my worst nightmare. He was dead. I was on a coach to London to get away and treat myself. I called her up just empty and in shock. I feel we were close, we spoke about our private issues. He was such an amazing man, he was there and comforted me in my darkest days when I didn’t think I could her through them. I listened to him when he had worries. And we chatted to one another. I miss him so much, I’m shocked, I don’t know what to do, what to think, what to feel And I’m dreading going home.
I have a habit of transferring my anger and emotions to people around me. I get angry at them for someone else's mistake. I get angry easily compared to a normal person. My gf doesn't want me anymore now. I don't get physical but i say a lot of mean things when i am angry. Sometimes I don't speak when I get angry. Sometimes my whole body starts shivering due to anger. I have destroyed a few relationships with people because of my anger. My ego and my anger are making me bad person. I don't know what I can do to reduce my temper. I have never been physical to anyone when I have been angry. Help will be appreciated.
"The reason everyone is telling you it's not the end of the world is because it's not the end of THEIR world. They don't have to figure out a way to live in a world that's over." As a younger person in my 20s, this show hit spot on for me.. People ignorantly telling her things like "you're young, you'll find someone else." I think that's the most frustrating sentence I've ever heard. I really think everyone should watch it and it's free to stream on Facebook Watch. I'm only a couple of episodes in and no, I'm not hopeful for the future or anything, but somehow it gave me the strength to put my gun back in the safe for now.
I've had thoughts about suicide, I met a girl a while back who has too. We became each others emotional crutch, we supported each other. To help her out, I introduced her to my freinds. She started getting close to one of them, I thought nothing of it at the time but now they are dating. Even though I confessed how I felt about her to my friend and her, they are now going out. I can no longer face my "friend" and I feel extremely lonely. I felt like she was the only person who actually cared about me, now I don't know.
In my house me mum bought a tea pot, so we had family come for abit and uno the usual “ want a cuppa” so i do the rounds and ask but as i go to leave the door me mum goes “make it in the tea pot” and when she said this all i seen was red. All i thought was “WHATS THE FUCKING POINT OF BOILING THE WATER THEN TO POUR IT INTO THE TEA POT TO THEN INTO THE CUP WHEN YOU COULD JUST POUR FROM KETTEL TO CUP” why is there a middle man in this wtf. Fuckin stupid twattin tea cuntin pot whats the fuckin point.
I live in a little shitty apartment complex in a poor side of town. Our refrigerator only works about 1 week out of the month and that is because we have to defrost it overnight. By doing so, it causes puddles and a lot of ruined food. Well, to prolong the need to defrost the fridge, I placed the eggs in the freezer. I was supposed to remove them two hours later, but forgot them over night. When I woke up, all of the eggs were all cracked and frozen over, I literally thought I was going to cry. **Over eggs.** Well, there went breakfast for the week! Then I decide that I should probably sit down and relax, smoke a cigarette, you know, **try to not be SO FUCKING MAD OVER EGGS?!** I then proceed to spend the next half a fuckin hour looking for my ID to make an attempt to purchase my cancer sticks. I am *tearing* my house up, throwing clothes everywhere, turning drawers upside down, and **DEMANDING** that the skygods produce my fucking ID or so help me Jesus, somebody was going to die. I eventually found my ID siting on the counter as if it had been there the whole time.....*son of a bitch...* Now I just have to clean the whole house? It all started with those fucking EGGS! Moral of the story is just DEFROST THE FUCKING FRIDGE!!! **TL;DR** OMFG! Ruined eggs, trashed house, missing ID, no smokes!
We’re at a point in time where disorders are used for attention. And that’s my problem with this. I’ve always had a lot of friends but none of them actually care about me.and I know that if I try to say anything they’ll act sorry for me but think and say that it was all for attention. I’ve always tried to cope with my problem by doing things like skating and anime. But those coping mechanisms are dying out. I don’t want to Kms but I want to be able to make close close friends to talk and skate with
Psych facts says that people who are lonely or depressed are more likely to sleep with multiple pillows. I have 4. How about you? Edit: One pillow: minimalist, practical, you don't want any clutter and wants to keep their space tidy 2 pillows: indecisive, prepared and may have a favorite 3 pillows: needy, cares about appearance, you can't put your head over 3 pillow, the third one will always be the one you always hug. Maybe you need a hug? 4 pillows : generous, functions in clutter, means you have plenty room in your bed and you feel a bit lonely and that you needed it to fill up for security? 5 or more: lonely and in need of comfort, it reflects that something is missing in your life, you may not be aware that you're lonely or you needed a hug. Hug? I'm not a psychologist. Just read that stuff so maybe we could reflect on ourselves? Anyway, have a cozy pillow filled day everyone.
This has been getting frustrating. In the beginning I just accepted what I was told... That due to staffing and workload it could take up to 3 months. This sucked, but I actually understood it because my wife had loved her crime television and I was familiar with the concept these could take some time. I had my mom call the Medical Examiners office last week, 3 months to the day aaaand... We were told the doctors in charge of my wife's case was in Florida. And that their paperwork still said pending so even though we'll check again in a couple of days, the person speaking wasn't hopeful I would be finding out. In fact they said it typically takes anywhere from 3... To 6 months. Which is just insane. It didn't bother me at first when it happened. Why do I care how she died (besides concerns for my son's future health), she is dead and I know it happened naturally. But the longer it goes the more it gnaws at me. And that's not even counting the fact that I need to start dealing with my life insurance and social security benefits which require a completed death certificate.
One of the most important people to me just passed two hours ago, from complications with Covid Pneumonia. I haven't seen him or his family in about two years, and the last he and I spoke was mid-summer last year. There was some sort of falling out between his wife and my mom; our families used to be incredibly close, they were basically my aunt and uncle for most of my teenage years. We weren't in super close contact when I was in undergrad, and I'm mostly through grad school and just now noticing how much I've missed seeing them/him a few times a week. I'm not sure how to deal with/approach the fact that I feel a little bit of resentment for everyone involved keeping me out of the loop as to why his family was gone. A mutual friend and I were talking, she thinks he may not have known how to approach getting in touch with me. I have a hard time processing emotions in any way other than numbness, but damn if this doesn't feel especially empty. We used to go see this band together any time we could, and the last show I went to was with my ex, and I hadn't even ever mentioned it to him even though I used to talk to him about every set list. He's such a big part of so many things that shape my identity, be it in music or art or interests. I just don't know how to handle feeling actual loss for the first time, I've made it to my mid-20s without ever losing someone I was actually close to. I know it's the human experience but I just wanted him to see me happy for once.
My husband and I just moved to his new duty station. I had an appointment on Monday, and was not sure exactly how to get there. Upon trying to figure out my surroundings I was pulled over on base for doing 37 in a 25 zone. The area did not look like a 25 zone at all. I feel so stupid that in my confusion of trying to figure out how to get to my appointment, that I neglected to pay attention to the speed limit sign. Now I am required to go to court tomorrow with my husband as my sponsor. I have never been pulled over before. I have been so upset, I can't even eat. I have no idea the repercussions it will have on my husband. I was reading online that this base has a zero tolerance policy and I will for sure have my license privileges on base revoked for 30 days. Now my husband has to take time out of work tomorrow to accompany my sorry ass to court. I hope they don't humiliate me there. I have never been to court, and I am extremely nervous. I take Prozac for anxiety and depression and my husband keeps saying most people get speeding tickets in their lifetime, that is is okay, but I don't feel okay. I feel horrible, depressed, anxious. I don't even want to drive. What seems little to my husband, such as a speeding ticket, feels detrimental to me, and the fact that I got it on base makes me feel even more like shit.
Is it normal to experience brain fog during grief?? I'm having issues with concentrating, retaining new information, becoming forgetful and especially struggling to express myself, by this I mean there have been more than a few occasions when I'd be chatting to someone, and I either forget what I'm about to say or struggle to find the right words. My mum passed away this year in July, so I know it hasn't been long, but I wanted to know if anyone else is in the same boat or if you had experienced brain fog and have now come out on the other side of it, what advice would you give? Feel free to share your experiences.
So for me this has been a problem that I have had for years but only started coming up more after I got with my long term partner of nearly 5 yrs now but what happens is that if we have any type of conversation now that he says I get a nasty, bitter and mean tone of voice. I don't really know that it is happening but i need it to stop for my sake and the sake of my relationship. I do have anger issues which I'm trying to work out but I don't even know how to. If anyone can give advice in any way it will be greatly appreciated.
This was about 4 years ago the day befor I was going to turn 13. My aunt was one of the closest people to me out of my family. She suffer from diabetes for as long as I can remember, but was always the glue to us all. A bit befor the day of my birthday my mother (my aunt is my mother's older sister and was a mother figure) and her had been planning for her to come down she planned on coming down the day befor my birthday. This is where it gets sad, I was at school and out of the blue I was signed out by my parents, I got in the car with then now thinking back somthing was off they acted like they normally did but looked gone. When we got home my mom sat me down on the couch and told me that my aunt had passed away in her sleep. At that moment all I could remember was saying no no no no over and over and sobbing hysterically the rest was a blur but my mother held me as me and her cried and my father silently cried. It was so sudden and unexpected the part that still destroys my mother is the night befor she died my aunt had called her but my mom didnt answer and forgot to call her back. To this day thinking about this makes me emotional, I miss her so much.
She tells me every single day that she loves me and wants to have a future with me. But I just don't have that same feeling I've had when we first started dating. We've been going out for 5 months now and we see each other pretty often since we live in the same apartment building. The last time I tried to break it up with her and tell her I do not want to move out, I backtracked once she asked "Do you not love me anymore?". I had a guilt trip and started to back out of it. Mainly because I was thinking, "If you weren't sure about getting into a serious relationship, why did you date someone that's 14 years older than you and waste her time?!" This is only my second gf and I never broke up with a girl before, it was always the other way around. I just don't get how things can move so fast for her....I've gotten helpful tips on here before and I am hoping I can find some reasoning to help me build courage to do this. --- **tl;dr**: wants to break up with gf but having guilt trips and delaying the breakup.
My relationship with my now ex boyfriend has ended. I was the emotionally abusive/toxic one in the relationship. Honestly, I didn't know in the moment. I hate myself for it. I genuinely love him with all of my heart, but I realize that I am no good for him. I know I'm capable of changing, but it'll take a long time and it's probably something that I have to work on myself. I just want to know how to let him go. I love him more than anything, and I'm struggling so hard to let go of him... it's so hard to move on from him. He isn't capable of being my friend because he still loves me, so we're on no contact. Has anyone been in this situation? TLDR; I need to let go of the person I love, because I was emotionally abusive and toxic.
so ive recently mentally shut down and i didnt know until i threw up this morning and felt sick to my stomach and yesterday i slept at 12:56 after staring at the wall and helping 3 people get back on their feet i sent my friend a picture because she sent one on instagram after i cleaned up of course because of school and she asked me well both of my friends asked me “your eyes arent shining anymore what happened? :[[“ and i dont get what it means dont eyes gloss when theyre wet is it like a metaphor phrase?
I got my weighted blanket Monday and its a godsend. Whenever I feel an anxiety attack coming I wrap myself in it like a cocoon and close my eyes. I can feel the tension draining. If I need a little help, I take 1/4 of the anxiety pill I was given and it all goes away. Sometimes I even fall asleep. Its like a giant comforting hug. CAVEAT:They are expensive. Mine was 194.00 including 25.26 shipping. Some are 300.00 without shipping. The blankets come in various weight ranging from 2 pounds ( for kids) to 20 pounds. Mine is 15. So if you can swing it, I'd try.
I smoked for the third time yesterday, so I sort of knew what to expect and in my previous highs I had relaxed and sat back listening to music with my friends. This time though I don't know if I did anything different, but I essentially passed out at my friend's house and I was stuck in this weird almost-asleep state where my mind was conscious but my body felt like it was asleep. My friend had to carry me home because I ended up having a panic attack. I felt helpless and I couldn't do anything except ask my friend to get me my meds. It took a lot of effort to form a coherent sentence, and even more effort to move my hand to my mouth and swallow. I couldn't do anything but lay there and wait until I fell asleep, which took a lot time because my heart rate was through the roof and I felt like I was shaking. I eventually fell asleep, but I'm not keen on getting high again because I do not want to risk that happening again. I'm just going to quit after that, which is fine for me, but I just wanted to know if anyone else has had an experience like that.
Hi, I guess I'm mostly looking for suggestions or advice. I can't get over my ex. It was a weird situation where she was living with an ex... but we ended up dating (because they were not)For about 6 months but we've been friends for 5 years, since high school to be exact. She became my best friend after a while as well. About several months into the relationship or dating, actually I'm not sure what to call it, she got pregnant and ultimately decided to have an abortion. Months later she decided things weren't working and she went back to her ex. I didn't want her to get an abortion and I've been struggling with this for a while. It's like I got the girl I always wanted and then lost her. What makes it so bad I can't even have relations with anyone because when I look in their eyes I see her. Moving on has been hard, we've been over for months and I've avoided sex with others because it won't be the same. Pointless sex has gotten old. We're still friends but only I still have strong feelings regarding the relationship. I've tried talking to other girls on tinder, etc but no one has given me the same feeling that she did. I've accepted we won't be together again as she's made this clear. I guess I'm just lost. Most days I can mask the feelings and just pretend everything is ok but honestly it's not. Anyone been in a similar situation, how'd you move on? The abortion still hurts a lot. **TL;Dr I can't move on**
I've been studying with 2 guys from my program for 2 months now. Recently, one of them said to the other: "most girls in this program are in relationships". There was silence and so I jumped in with "so who is your crush?" He didn't say but then asked me "who do you like?". Why did he first made that comment about girls in the program? And how did he know I'm single? --- **tl;dr**: One of 2 guys that I've been studying with made the comment to the other "most girls in this program are in relationships". The conversation then leads to him asking who I like. How did he know I'm single?
My parents recently divorced. I was a daddy's girl. I had a very rocky relationship with my mom who struggles with mental health. It turns out my step dad who raised me had cheated on my mom for a couple of years with prostitutes. My sister who used to be my best friend was not raised by my step dad and now won't talk to me because I still have a relationship with him. My mom and I are distant. She sent me a letter pretty much telling me she won't be there for my wedding or if I ever have kids. I still haven't dealt with it all. I haven't talked to any of my family really. My dad reaches out but I don't know how I'm supposed to be. I feel alone. Like I have no one. I have tried to reach out to my sister multiple times. Even apologizing for nothing but she am met with rejection. Any advice on what to do or moving on? I am currently seeing a therapist. But I'm not sure it's really doing me any good. My anxiety and depression are at an all time high.
All of you probably know what I am talking about. Just out of nowhere comes this DAY. This totally unbelievable SAD day. I haven't cried today but my eyes are swollen and red as tho I've been crying for hours. I sigh deeply looking for enough breath. Everything I do reminds me. Everything. I remember too vividly. My whole being is clouded. Almost six weeks now. Yes, I've had some breakfast and had something to drink. I took a mile walk. The sadness persisted and has even grown some. I hope I can sleep it away tonight. I know it won't last forever. ... Your posts give me that hope. Deep breathing sighs looking for enough air. No one except folks who have lost what we have lost ... know about this. Know how long it lasts. Know how all-consuming it is. I hope all of us find some peace some day.
I know the title might sound a bit weird, but honestly knowing what goes on in the world in regards to animal abuse seriously makes me want to give up. I really try to do what I can to do my part (donate, volunteer, go vegan) but I still can’t forget what goes on in the rest of the world that I have no control over. The though of so many animals going through such intense distress and pain everyday literally breaks my heart and I sob pretty much everyday about it. I’m in therapy but nothing can make me feel better about it and I just can’t learn to deal / live with it. I don’t see how I can live the rest of my life feeling so helpless and heartbroken for these creatures and just watch it get worse and worse as the world is more and more over populated. I just want to end it now so I don’t have to feel this way anymore.
TL;DR my ex ghosted me and is still checking my social media even though he has a new girl. We broke up about 2 months and has been seeing his current girl for about a month. Me [24 F], Ex[32 M] Why is it deemed an acceptable form of breaking a relationship by ghosting someone? I recently got ghosted by my ex and there’s no bad blood between us. He’s best friends with my brother in law. So not to make things weird or awkward I’m friendly which I think confuses the bejesus out of him hahah. He’s got a new girl and I am actually happy for him. But why do people feel it’s okay to just cut and run from a relationship without a drop of a line? Honestly breaking up over text isn’t as bad as just cutting out cold turkey! Also he’s still checking my Instagram and stories like brah if you didn’t want anything to do with me why you still creeping my page? Ugh I feel like he’s trying to get noticed or keep me as an option...? I don’t know but I feel weird that he’s checking my posts so fast and often. I swear as soon as I post an Instagram story he’s one of the first 10 to view it on both of his accounts. Do you think he’s still interested or just trying to make himself get noticed or just curious? No judgement if you’ve done this to your ex, I just want to know why?
Well guys once again my anger has out me in a bad situation. So, today at school i was at lunch and some kids that i sit with said I had to go do pay someone a dollar and they'd play a song during our lunch on these speakers or i'd kicked out of the table and just go to the bathroom like i did for the first half of the year. So i went and on my way up someone took the dollar and i wasn't going to fight him over it because it wasn't mine so i thought they'd understand but no. The kid who gave me the dollar took my backpack and took out my school issued laptop, ripped the case off and proceeded to break the top and bottom case, i sat and watched expressionless for about a minute. At this point the 12-14 people at the table are looking at me and i got increasingly angrier and then all of the sudden i slammed my fist into the table and left to the bathroom, while in there i destroyed 2 of the toilet paper holders in a couple punches, slammed my fist into the wall and went to the next bathroom because its quite and usually empty so i went there, while in said bathroom i punched one of the old rusty lockers inside the bathrooms and fucked up my knuckles so i stayed in there for 30 minutes after lunch during class time not wanting to be seen by my classmates like this. I'm not going to tell anyone because it will just lead to more shit but needed to tell someone because it helps i guess.
So, I do have some experience with this concept. I have actually watched a few videos on YouTube, talking about how anger is an emotion that is a cover-up feeling to defend from the powerless feeling of violation, but I never thought that I would be privy to it. (famous fucking last words) Recently, I've noticed that a lot of my own anger -- and I'm talking about that juicy, white-hot, hypertensive resentment -- comes from a place of feeling violated. And I mean that in the general, figurative sense, like a value, boundary or moral is violated, but I have noticed as well that -- despite never having been sexually assaulted or mistreated in any way -- I get a boiling sense of emasculation whenever my mother tries to touch me or "helicopter" me around in one thing or another. As a person who has a clingy, oedipal, elicopter parent, I'm often invalidated for my frustrations with this, and told that I should just appreciate her because she loves me so much, and unfortunately for both these hippie-types, and me, all it's really done is caused me to try and bypass, overlook and not truly process any feelings of violation. This has not boded well for my health, and psychological wellbeing. Does anyone have any tips/wanna commiserate over similar experiences?
I believe I had a miscarriage not too long ago, but would have been 4 weeks. Didn't take a preg test or anything but my very consistent period was late. When my . Did come it was heavy and painful, more so than usual. Fast forward to today. I am... was pregnant 5 weeks 6 days in. We've been trying for a while. I couldn't believe it finally happened. On Friday I finally made all the ultrasound apps, even downloaded a baby app to see it growing... then I wake up this morning to blood and cramps... it sucks. The worst part is the thought of knowing I have to call and cancel all my appts... I don't want to be reminded of it. It hurts and it sucks.. and I really really don't want to go to some emergency room to sit there for hours just to hear what I already know, the baby is gone...
I used to feel bad after getting angry with people but its just blatant no one really cares about anyone anymore. I try to apply the golden rule to everything treat others as you wish to be treated right? So what do I do when what is important to myself is constantly being taken, used, and forgotten about with absolutely no regard or remorse? The last thing I want is to yell about anything, Its actually one of the things I dislike the most on a daily basis either projected or received. But eventually It just happens I flow into a seething rage clenched teeth and taught muscles. I've stopped feeling the regret when it happens I just feel more and more hate. My teeth hurt. My muscles everywhere are sore. and my throat is burning. After it happens my mind is racing and full of anger for hours and I cant stop it. Why do people screw me over?
My bio mom is amazing and I(13F) love her so much and the thought that I love my stepmom(34F) more hurts me so much but I really wish my stepmom was my bio mom. I've been staying at my dad's and every night before bed she kisses my forehead and tells me to have a good night! My mom has never done that and it makes me sad. My stepmom is so cool and funny and shes so much more understanding and I can talk to her about anything! Is it bad that I love her more than my bio mom even though my bio mom is a good mom? (When I say love I mean platonically just to make things clear) tl;dr: both of my moms are good but I love my stepmom more
im kind of ranting here i just want to type i guess, enjoying the doors right now, hence the throwaway been seven months since we've broke up, longest ive gone without talking to her is two months, felt the closest to being over her then, but still thought about her daily. Everything comes back so quickly though. my happiness hinges on her, i cant stand it, and i cant stop it... have tried meeting new people, i really dont like talking to people i dont know, i am scared i guess, i find myself speaking very low and just wanting to end the conversation and get away as fast as possible. im 22, ive had two real girlfriends and they were both really outgoing people that pursued me aggresively. i really want to be with her, but i know its never going to happen. I know i would be happier if i moved on, but i cant help it. In the seven months since we've broke up she usually called/texted once a month to see what i was up too, i enjoyed hearing from her but it always hurt. I guess i should probably tell her not to talk to me anymore, I know that is best, but I cant bring myself to do that, as much as it might make sense
Last Friday I found out that I have a blighted ovum miscarriage. Despite two rounds of Mistoprostol, it didn’t work and now I need to have a D&C. The consultation with the doctor was today. When she walked in I was so grateful to have a mask on. She’s heavily pregnant in her third trimester and was consulting me on options to deal with my D&C. Which I do not want but I need to get! It seemed like some sick ‘punked’ joke. I am not mad that the doctor is pregnant but why in god’s name would they have her consulting to grieving patients who are experiencing a miscarriage?! Can they not change around the OB schedule?! I can’t even talk to my sister on the phone right now because she’s breastfeeding her infant and he coos too much. Luckily she understands. It’s all too much. It’s like every corner is a reminder of the lost pregnancy.
I want to make it perfectly clear that this is unintentional. I never wanted to be the guy that went out with girls 10 years younger than him but that's what's happened. I keep meeting girls at shows or just out at bookstores or whatever. I think they're cute and ask them out. Somewhere while texting I find out how old they are and I'm presented a choice. Either keep talking to them or stop. I always keep talking. Here's the thing I really don't like, I'm starting to enjoy it. It's just less complicated. Is it wrong of me to be doing this? tl;dr I would especially like women's pov on this. I've already had a female friend give me shit for it saying I'm basically sleeping with children. For clarification: by easier I mean that I like hanging out and hooking up, not interested in relationships. So far, girls I've met around my age aren't open to that, not saying they're not out there, just I don't regularly meet them.
I took up running recently. I am slightly obese on the BMI scale. I run 3.1 miles (5k) every time I run. I slowly worked up to it on the couch to 5k plan. What does this have to do with this sub? On about the last mile everything starts to hurt a little, I start to feel like garbage and I get really angry. If I'm listening to a business podcast, every time the host or guest mentions their accomplishments I get angry with self talk like "why am I not that successful yet!?". Normally, that would just be under the surface, but when I run it gets magnified and I'm showing my teeth and practically growling. The longer I run the angrier I get. When I experience this anger, I use the techniques from "The Untethered Soul" by Michael Singer. He asks, when you experience strong emotions "who is watching that?" He says you should find the place in the body where the emotion is being felt. For me, I feel anger in my forehead and lungs and stomach. So I direct my attention to those areas as if I'm contemplating a minor bruise I got in those areas. This helps me get practice for when I feel angry at other times. When I stop running I feel awesome and not angry. This has always made me wonder why I have a hard time getting started running. I think it's because it makes me angry while doing it and I try to avoid that. Now that I look at it as a way to safely experience intense anger I feel compelled to do it more and more.
I was diagnosed with ADHD early on in my life and somehow "grew" out of it and haven't taken meds in ~7 years. I used to always be very cool and calm and was able to suppress any sort of anger I would have but now I feel like I'm slipping. I'm 21 now and decided to take a semester off of school and being home, with no one my age to hang out/live with contributes to my slipping of my anger. I'm trying to find a job but it's hard to find a good FT job since I'm going to have to take a week off in Feb and May for my GF coming here and then going to see her in May (She is international). All my friends were at school which was in a different state, 1000 miles away. I've noticed that I'm starting to get annoyed with people more then I used too which leads to small outbursts. I now get more annoyed when technology doesn't work which usually results in me taking my anger out on inanimate objects. I seem to get more annoyed at my GF when we skype when she can't figure out things on her computer and while I haven't had an outburst yet, I want to make sure I never do. All of this doesn't seem like much which is where I want to keep it, I don't want it to slip into the type of anger that I used to have when I was younger and just be an asshole to everyone. What type of things can I do to minimize my Anger and general annoyance with people?
I have a few things to get done for university and I cant for the life of me relax when I decide to take breaks... I feel like its part of the reason the breaks I take are so long because Im trying to relax but never manage to. I cant even bring myself to touch my games so I do stuff thats aimless and I just never cool off, maybe even get more amped up. And I still have it dug into the back of my head that even when I finish the work Im still going to be a bag of stress because I have to do presentations along with these projects... and dont get me started on the presentations... its like... no one has any advice other than just practice more or write a script. Things Ive already done. Talking in front of people I know is fine. When Im being genuinely judged in a class or special event... its very not fine. I have a little less than 3 weeks for a huge paper with a presentation a little after and like... 8 days for another thing thats mostly a presentation but also a small written paper and a dang sculpture that I havent started and I need to lead a discussion in 3 weeks. One of my classes is doing a restoration project of sorts and like... Im the only one who cares. My head is going to explode. At least if Im ignored venting vaguely helped...
I've been chasing this girl for a year now, and here's a summary of what she texted me other day while she was drunk. She was telling me how I'm a great person, how I'm the best thing that ever happened to her, how I'm the only guy that respects her and cares for her. which I'm like fuck yeah, I've been persistent and now she's coming around this is lit. (by being persistent I mean she treats me like absolute shit and it's so hard not to leave her). and then she basically says that she wishes she could like me romantically, but I'm too fat. I started running 4K's back in OCTOBER because of her, everyday, and she hits me with this, months later. and no I'm not like super fat, I'm just bigger than most 16yr olds, and it's super annoying because it seems like I can't lose weight, like I've lost a shit ton of weight, like 50+ but I don't see it visually, at all, I want to fucking die (not actually, it's an expression, don't tell me how my life's worth it, I don't actually wanna kms) but yeah, she chooses looks over personality, and it fucking sucks shit.
My boss (she's the store manager, I'm the assistant) has anxiety. I know this because she had a nervous breakdown a few weeks ago and her friend called me to tell me so. She is a perfectionist, and my company keeps adding responsibilities and 'standards' to our already heavy workload, to the point where it's just impossible to keep up with. Maybe once a month, she has what we referred to as her 'kooky' days. She normally completely has her shit together, she's very well put together, energetic and fun. But on these days, you can tell just by looking at her that she's not with it. Her eyes are completely glazed over, she rants about her personal life, she slurs her words, she mumbles to herself. She tells me stories and repeats herself. She doesn't even recognize that she's at work, I try to get time sensitive stuff done (conference calls, opening the door) and she's ranting about redoing her closet. She can barely walk without falling. I ended up working a double shift on Saturday because I was afraid to leave her alone. My question is...could this be an effect of an overdose of anti anxiety medication? I'm not sure exactly what it is, and I obviously can't ask her why she's acting like this
hi everyone, I just found this subreddit! i’ve been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder for about three years and went to therapy for the first two. I was feeling a lot better so I stopped going until recently. I have a lot of stress in my life right now because i’m finishing up school soon and applying to graduate schools. so anyways, i’ve been waking up in the mornings and having heart palpitations then and also just randomly throughout the day. i’ve been trying to limit my coffee intake, as i’m sure that’s making it worse. I was just wondering if anyone here has experienced this and what you did to cope with it or fix it?
TL;DR I have been told (by friends) that I have been encouraging of sort of unhealthy behaviors. The main comment I heard was that I encourage her to be “obsessive” among other behaviors. I was hoping for an outside perspective on this and advice on what I should do if anything at all. In the past I know I have encouraged “bad” behaviors in friends without being aware, so it could be possible. For example I apparently used to indirectly tell people to be more “pushy and controlling”. Apparently when we get I get into arguments I “obviously want to be physically abused.”My friends seem to have this narrative that I directly seek out unhealthy relationships that are emotionally/physically unhealthy. Obviously I completely disagree with them, but I am trying to get their view across. Anyway my girlfriend already was “obsessive,” according to the friends who were telling me these things. It’s not that I am directly encouraging obsessiveness, I just feel loved when she says stuff like she “spent the whole day thinking about me,” or plans out my weeks (what I eat, who I can talk to, where I go, what I wear etc.). Is this even that obsessive? Why is this bad to encourage? I guess I am wondering if it seems like I do want an emotionally/physically unhealthy relationship. Also, am I encouraging unhealthy behavior? Is encouraging unhealthy behaviors inherently bad? I mean if we acknowledge that it is unhealthy, is it ok to do just in this relationship?
My boyfriend and I (both mid 20s) have been dating for 1.5 years. The first couple times we had sex he held me down and choked me and it was rough. I loved it! And I told him I did. Maybe a month or so in, the sex started to be very straightforward and vanilla (no hate to anyone who likes it that way). I told him repeatedly that I’m very submissive and I love being told what to do. I also don’t get turned on from initiating sex, which maybe comes off as lazy, but to get in the mood I like to feel wanted. He sometimes will say kind of dominant things like “tell me who’s your daddy” or “do you like how my cock feels” but it’s rare. He’s very closed off sexually. I tried to watch porn with him a few times and he said he felt awkward. He doesn’t talk openly about sex. He very awkwardly comments on my body (once in a blue moon). To note, for the past 6-8 months, I’ve been on different antideprsssants and I haven’t felt like myself sexually. Lower libido. I’m getting off them but part of me wonders if it’s because I’m disappointed by our sex. It’s also dwindled but I can’t say that’s his fault. I don’t know what to do. I love him and wish there was an easy fix. I feel kind of selfish about the whole thing but I do feel sort of catfished since he started off the relationship in a much more rough/dominant way. It still gives me a feeling of hope. Any thoughts? Tl;dr I’m submissive and my boyfriend was very rough in the beginning but is now vanilla. Poor communication as well.
I live near where one of the most damaging tornados of recent history hit. I'm smack dab in the middle of tornado alley. Back in 2008, my town was hit and alot of my neighborhood was destroyed or damaged. This includes flattening my garage, and nearly pulling the roof of my house. I was 7 years old. After that incident, I was utterly obsessed with the weather. I watched nothing but the weather channel and even went so far as to tag along with my parents to a storm spotting class. The tornado also left me very afraid of storms. This fear kind of went away after a year or so, until 2011, when the horrific tornado I alluded to earlier struck, and I was just filled with dread, thinking it was going to destroy my town (even though it wasnt in the path) and kill me. After that, every time there would be a weather alert, whether it be severe or minor, I get anxious. And this is one of few things that make me anxious. I'm talking about that feeling I get when it feels like someone jabbed a knife in my stomach to pull the knot out. Also, though it may be weird, it also makes me have to use the bathroom. I'm now almost 19, and no matter how slim the risk of something even slightly dangerous happening, I dread it. I dont know how to stop myself from worrying.
I have bipolar along with anxiety and I’m taking antipsychotics for it and recently I noticed very minor tremors/jerkiness in my hands and feet and mouth a bit. These medications are known to have a risk of Tardive Dyskinesia (albeit low risk) and I can’t. Stop. Worrying. I know anxiety can cause tremors too so it may certainly be making it much worse than it is and I’ve also had a lot of coffee up until the last 2 days and I’m pre-diabetic so in short, tremors aren’t new at all for me. How do I stop worrying? Everyone tells me to relax but I wouldn’t be worrying over nothing. Why does body/life keep giving me things to worry about?
It seems like nearly every film I watch, it features the method he used to die. They're so graphic, even if you normally can't see the whole thing, but it's absolutely traumatising the detail that is included. It mightn't help that I love history (which therefore means history films). I don't know. Just really shit. Normally I can just move past it (I very much just *shut off*) but yesterday I was watching a film with my boyfriend and it happened. I burst in to tears. My boyfriend is very good in these circumstances, whenever a scene like that comes on, he immediately puts his hands over my eyes, comforts me... even if it's just mentioned he rubs my hand/leg and is just comforting in general. But yesterday I was so overcome with horror. It was tough. Still feeling it now.. I'm very lucky to have my boyfriend to support me through this, though.
Over the past two weeks I have been feeling super weird. It started the week before school & I suddenly started having bad sleeps (waking up 3 times a night, vivid dreams, etc)- I thought it was just gonna last 2 days but it’s been going on for about 2 weeks now. School started last week and I have 8 am classes everyday so I wake up early but don’t have good sleep either. I keep having weird vivid dreams that I hate (idk why but dreams gives me anxiety) & throughout the day I feel exhausted and super dissociated. Idk what’s going on- I keep feeling impending doom. Like I’m supposed to be worried for something but idk what it is. I feel like I’m losing my mind... what if I go crazy??? Become schizophrenic? What’s going on!!! I’m getting worried and now my sleep anxiety has gotten worse. I also feel so sluggish and unmotivated to do anything. Please help :(
Yesterday night I had been stretching a bit, and while I was twisting my body side to side I felt a small tearing pain around my left pec area. I had look up aortic dissection previously, and soon after I started thinking that's what I had just done. I immediately felt a bit breathless and dizzy, but that moment passed shortly. Later on, I had a more involuntary twitch while trying to sleep, and that caused another sharp tearing pain. The symptoms came back again, as well as a strange cold/wet feeling in the area where I felt the tear. Now I'm sitting up in bed at 10 am because I'm afraid to go to sleep, in case I did actually tear something serious. As some other people have said, obviously I probably wouldn't be typing this if I had actually torn my aorta, but the symptoms are still here and they have me worried. I don't know if a twist is enough to tear something like that, but now I'm just worried about the tear rupturing if there is one. Don't think I'm getting any sleep today.
I ( 17 M ) started talking to Her ( 17 F ) a year ago. we met online and chatted for a bit, I wanna make it clear that she took the first move and actually starting flirting with me, took me a while to catch on as usual. recently she started to give emotes and " xD "s to most messages, I'm starting to feel as if she doesn't wanna get indulged into a conversation, am i rushing things ? We've been talking for a year now and I have tried to start a conversation that isn't hi, I love you, goodnight she never talks about herself much if at all. Is it lack of conversation skills or am I missing something ? tl;dr " broke my back holding the conversation " situation, relationship not going anywhere.
So I initially went to the psychiatrist about two weeks ago and I was up front about all of my prior drug use. I've been clean for 2 1/2 years now. He put me on Viibryd daily and Gabapentin as needed. I know you aren't supposed to feel anything for weeks, I felt Viibryd probably on the first but definitely on the second day. It didn't feel bad at all. The second day I noticed it took me a little more to (sexually) get off. The third day it definitely took me longer to get off. The fourth day I take a nap, wake up and motor functioning seems a little weird. I try to drink from a glass of water and my hand is just shaking like crazy. I called nurse and told her, she deadpanned. I asked if I should keep taking it or what. She puts me on hold, comes back, says the doctor told me to stop taking it. Told my counselor today and he was like "Wow, after 4 days huh?" I feel like an idiot, like maybe I overreacted to it. I'm worried they're skeptical and don't trust me anyway because of me telling them about my extensive drug use. But I told them that to be honest and come clean, because the more accurate picture they have of me and my life, the better they can understand and treat my anxiety/depression. I guess I'm worried they won't believe me or trust me when I tell them about this.
He was always a cheerful guy and had things a bit rough. He was working at McDonald's. I went to school with him for 11th grade only but kept in touch after that. 2015 was a rough year for me. I don't remember when I found out he died, but I remember seeing stuff on his FB profile. I checked it out and learned he had died in a car accident. Guy left behind a young daughter. He would have been 26 a few days ago. It's weird to know someone who died that young. The pic he has for his obituary was our senior class pic. I remember where we were and how everything went as we were taking photos like yesterday.
I live abroad, away from home. I don't get to visit my beloved cats often. Today, my family gave away 5 cats we owned to our uncle in the countryside. I found one of them when she was a stray kitten when I was 16, I cared for her when she grew older and had a litter of her own. One offspring from that litter gave birth to another litter, and from that, it makes 2 out of the 5. The other two are a pair my sister found abandoned in a box with a dead sibling. I don't know why they decided to give the cats away, and I never took them seriously. Today, my mom sent me pictures of the cats in their new home. My uncle already has 3 cats and a kitten of his own, so my cats will have new friends. The field is also very big they can play in but I know my cats and they're lazy, I doubt they'd like it as much as my mom think they would. My uncle has 3 young children and I'm sure they'll love them as much as I did. But I'm still sad. They were my cats. Damn it mom they were my cats. I'd fly them here if I could. Fuck.
Ive been dating a girl for about a month now. It's not my first relationship but its definitely my first "serious" one. We both really like each other and she makes me very happy. She recently revealed to me her past experiences with other people particularly her past sexual expierences. This should be fine but for some reason it started to really bother me because I haven't really had any serious sexual expierences myself. I'm pretty inexperienced and it's starting to make me feel like I'm not good enough for her. It also bothers me a little that she's had experiences with other guys but that's really unfair of me and I start to feel like a peace of shit for thinking that. I don't feel confident with myself in the relationship anymore and I'm afraid of losing her because she really makes me happy. But now I'm afraid to do anything with her because I'll be inadequate. Any advice? TL;DR My girlfriend is more expierenced sexually than me and it's really bothering me
So for the past few years I have had a lot of intrusive thoughts. Basically throughout my life I have been bullied, mocked, made fun of and laughed at by a lot of people. I have Aspergers, social anxiety, overweight and socially dumb and awkward. As well as having really looked down upon jobs such as Manuel labour and cleaning making me a easy target for people to laugh at and make fun of. For the past few years whenever I remember these people and events I get angry and have thoughts about beating them up but these fantasies I go way too far, as in beating them to death. Usually when I have these unwanted fantasies my body uncontrollably do the motions, as in I punch walls, stomp on the floor and bang. Now I don’t want to kill anyone but I am afraid of actually killing someone in my anger. There’s this one guy who has been picking on my since Primary school. I’m 25 now and I still see him very occasionally, and I still see him smirking at me or giving me funny looks. Luckily the last couple times he’s either been in a car or on his motorcycle. I don’t actually know where he lives exactly but I know it is close to where I live. I am afraid of next time I see him I will indeed hit him but I am worried I’ll go too far. I don’t want to kill anyone or have these fantasies and to stop having these memories that upset me and lead to me having these fantasies.
We've been together for just shy of 2 years, and at present I have no intention of breaking up with him so please don't suggest this route. He is kind, caring, and understanding of my issues and in past we have discussed disagreements and issues successfully. We're both pretty adventurous, enjoy bdsm, and there's not much that's off limits when it comes to sex. He's acknowledged and been very encouraging of my efforts to come out of my shell (bad, bad past), and we tend to have a good time. Thing is he's jokingly mentioned several times now about him "putting in more effort", and eventually joked that he's the "settler" sexually. I'd pass it off as just a joke, but if someone jokes about something so often, it's clearly not a joke. To my mind I've been putting in a lot of effort and interest, and continue to be open minded to new ideas, but maybe I'm giving myself too much credit. I'm hoping for some advice on personal growth/improvement that may help, or perhaps just advice on how to approach the topic with him as I'm honestly unsure where to begin without just getting upset. Thanks in advance :) TL:DR Bf isn't a dirtbag, but has made it clear he feels he's settled for me sexually; want advice to approach the topic/improve myself, for both the relationship and my own self esteem.
I have been working at my job for 6 years. In that six years I have only received $2.05 in raises, and two of those raises (about 1.75) was because of mandatory minimum wage raises. I was promised a raise for taking on the role of a manager. I was told there was a three month probationary period for the raise. 7 months later I receive my promised "raise" when the minimum wage went up to the amount that my raise was supposed to be. I work in retail and manage the most difficult department in the store. I have limited time to do the things that I need to do, and the expectations are growing bigger and bigger by the day. I don't know what to do. I am at the point where I feel like I am about to walk out and quit daily, which I know is a bad idea. What would you do if you were me? Tldr; working as a manager, only making minimum wage.
In two days time I have to go to the dentist and get some work done. Needless to say I am petrified. The last time I had to get any work done on my teeth, the dentist (a different one) did not prescribe antibiotics and I ended up get a really bad infection in my jaw and had to some of my gums scraped out of my mouth. I am scared to go. Even writing this is causing me anxiety because it is becoming more real. My question is: how do you deal with having to go the dentist to have work done. I will not be knocked out. I will have novocaine but nothing else. I have some meds that I take but I am afraid that they will not work this time. I am probably making a mountain out of a molehill but I just don't know what to do.
I’ve found lately that my anger is often stemmed or triggered by small things that go “unpunished”. It’s like I demand justice. It’s almost always small things I can’t control. Example: someone cuts me off in traffic. It makes us all mad. But for some reason I feel more angry that they get away with it than the actual action. My anger becomes uncontrollable because they got away with something. I often hear that “Karma will catch up” or something to that end. But it’s like if I don’t see a punishment nothing matters. I’m not sure how to control anger in the moment that someone got away with something. Or why I fee so strongly that some sort of justice should be served.
I locked you up inside my rib cage. Maybe that's why you broke out. Did you feel confined. I thought it would have made you feel safe. Do you feel warmer now, under the sun in the west? Thousands of miles away from me. I know you had to leave. You told me. Why didn't you trust me, love. I thought we could plant our roots into the same dirt, and grow into the sky together. It turns out you were suffocating, desperate for sunlight. Is that my fault. Why wouldn't you listen. Why wouldn't I listen. Why did you turn to the poison every time you needed consolation. Was my voice not enough. Could we not have just fallen into one another. Or is someone else's embrace tighter. Love, the nights are the worst. Why do you enjoy haunting me? My ghost, I despise what you say to me, but I adore the smile you back it with. Will you not come back to me. Love, please tell me why you are so sick. Why did you strike me so many times, and why did I strike back in the end. What kind of a man am I to do so. Possessive. Anxious. Controlling. Obsessive. Angry. Mistrusting. Trapped. The both of us. Are you even love. Or are you disguised as it. What about the laughter. And the late night dream filled talks. The sense of humor and the same passionate touch. Only occasionally did we turn dark. But it was enough, wasn't it. Volatility. I should've met you years from this point. We are too sick.
Had to make the decision to put down my 17/18 y.o dog 4 days ago, and I'm struggling with so much guilt. I say 17/18 bc im not 100% sure how old she was, I've only had her a few years, but I've known her her whole life. (She was w family before me) I feel so guilty I didn't spend enough time with her especially in her last days. I feel like she didn't feel loved. I was in denial that she was deteriorating and thought she would be around for a little while longer. I wanted a last day with her but I didn't get that because of my selfishness and denial. We booked her euthanasia for the same day because it wasn't fair for her to continue living. I'm also scared and guilty in case we put her down too soon and we just over reacted. I feel guilty I didn't spend time with her and would do anything to go back and spend all the time with her. I feel guilty I took her to the vet and they injected her with the sedative and then put her to sleep, she had no idea what was coming. I just feel so much guilt and miss her so much.
I keep screwing up. Every time try to fix something I just screw up more. I've been friends with this one girl for a long time now and we just got in this fight after I did her a favor and she wouldn't tell me something I rlly needed to know(said it was too much of a long story). I realize it was dumb and tried to apologize. She didn't respond or just a "ok". One day I just broke down I don't know guess I was just desperate. We argued again. We had fights before but this time I think I lost a friend all over a stupid favor. I don't have many friends left anymore, they all kinda just left me. I'm alone and feel utterly pathetic just broken. Idk if this is the right sub, but I just felt like venting. I feel so sad.
I [21F] have been friends with him [19M] for 7 months and our connection is undeniable. I started off viewing him only as a friend, but when I really got to know him, my feelings for him started to develop. Fast forward to today, our romantic feelings are mutual and he wants to be in a relationship, but I told him it wasn't the right time for me - and it really isn't, I'm busy with college, work, and we live about 45 minutes away from each other. He also works a lot and I barely get to see him as is. If I have a day off, he works - and if he has a day off, I'm busy. The last time I saw him was a month ago, though we both text each other and talk every day. I really don't know what to do. I want to be in a relationship with him, and our connection is so amazing I don't want to let this go. It's cheesy, but I can see us lasting forever. But I'm scared it won't last because of our schedules and the distance. I personally don't have a issue with a long distance relationship (if that's what you can even call it), but I don't know how he would feel about it. Guys, I really need help. Any advice would be appreciated. <3 --- **tl;dr**: Fell in love with friend, feelings are mutual, both of us want a relationship. But I don't know if our busy lives (and distance) will impact our relationship to the point where we'll break up, or if It's even worth trying.
Long story short I'm super annoyed about my husband Sam's spending habits. He spent almost 150$ on takeout delivery in the past 3 weeks, when I'm over here trying to stay under 20$ while getting groceries. We haven't had a date night in months. Hell, we haven't had sex in a few months. And I've been attempting to initiate almost everyday. I've been crying because I feel unloved and there's no intimacy in our marriage. I thought we were saving money. We're terribly in debt. We owe the hospital more money than he makes in a year. I'm a stay at home mom for our daughter. Planning on going back to work when she's a year old. Just a few more months. But that's a different post for a different time. I don't know why I'm here. Just venting I guess. When he gets home from work today we're gonna have a serious conversation. Any tips or advice on how not to lose my cool while talking to him and any advice. TL;DR Husband spending too much money on takeout. We're broke. Help me articulate my thoughts before we talk today. How should I approach this?
My husband and I have been married four years. When we aren’t fighting, it’s great. Beyond great. But we fight all. The. Time. From my perspective, 95% of our fights involve either him being stressed out at work and taking it out on me (example: I told him yesterday that I had shown a picture to a friend of mine and she commented how nice he looked. This led to two hours of him yelling at me about how he didn’t want me showing pictures to my “shitty friends” (he has never met this person and does not actually have issues with my friends), or him doing something SUPER inconsiderate (say, being really late to a family meeting to decide on end-of-life stuff for a close relative, leaving me to go alone, because he was talking to his ex-wife about what iPhone she should get) and me objecting to it. This is a problem. It is an even bigger problem that no matter how neutral and conciliatory I am in addressing a problem with him, it literally ALWAYS becomes a total man-tantrum about how he hates being criticized and always has to apologize for things. I don’t know what to do. We have tried counseling, but essentially he just says that the counselors are criticizing him too. Is there ANYTHING I can do here short of leaving? TL:DR: My husband shuts down any discussions of relationship issues by yelling about how I always criticize him.
Alright, short thing that I’ve debated trying to articulate, and I just decided fuck it. I’ll be a weirdo if need be. Haha Forgive the formatting and other nonsense. This is kind of a brain dump so bear with me.. I don’t do it as often now, (it’s been over a year) but I still occasionally look at pictures of myself from right before he died and compare them to every picture after. I don’t know what exactly I’m looking for, but I think I’m trying to see if his death had a physical impact. Like, I felt it so deeply, is it possible that it didn’t show on my skin? I can’t tell if I want to look worse now; more tired, old, beaten down, etc. I think that probably depends on the day, if I’m honest. I’ll just comb through old pictures for hours and compare them side by side. I’ve stopped looking for signs in his old pictures, incidentally. I see it all over his face. I don’t need to keep looking. I am finally getting to the point where I can accept that he made his choice and my options are to respect it and move on, or rally against it and suffer indefinitely. I just can’t seem to let go of looking for a change in myself. Am I alone here? Edit to clarify slightly: He died over a year ago. I still do this semi regularly.
Hi guys, I have had a really rough last few years, I was in a car crash which caused severe injuries then a year after that my mom died. I have been struggling with bad anxiety as a result of all the stress over these few years which often turns into panic. I have noticed I get anxious most often in my room, which you guessed it, is where I game all the time. For example if I play Overwatch competitive, I'm normally an anxious wreck after a few games. I've been trying to think what has set it off- is it the intense focusing on the match, the 'stress' of trying to win, the 'threat' of losing. The general tension of trying your best. I'm not sure. Has anyone here seen improvements in anxiety after quitting these types of games? I feel like I am just making my anxiety worse by triggering it in these competitive games. I think FPS games for me are the most anxiety inducing. Thank you for any replies.
Recently I've realized that my anger has been getting the better of me and it mostly revolves around something traumatic that I am trying to get past/heal from. I'm hurting people because they hurt me, but I know I am accountable for what I do today. Slip ups are most definitely a thing and I can go into meltdown mode if I haven't been doing well and penting everything up instead of communicating, etc. Well I'd just like some advice and pointers maybe on what to do if you are ever with someone who is having a meltdown. What not to do, too. How to handle that state of emergency, really, as an onlooker. And for myself I'd like to know some wisdom on identifying when it's about to happen, like what do you feel? And handling it when it's already come on, what things can I do? I do have some tactics, just curious to hear more. Thanks!
We’ve been together for three years, but this is really starting to get to me. I’m not into super weird stuff, just stuff like BDSM, domination/submission, etc. My girlfriend in the other hand is super vanilla. She likes sex, and that’s about it. Every time i bring my fetishes up, she finds some way to make me feel bad about them, usually asking why I would want to tie her up or hurt her, drawing a parallel to actual abuse, something I would obviously never do. This extends to some other things too, like oral. I enjoy giving and receiving, she claims she doesn’t enjoy receiving, and only enjoys giving when in the mood. Ok, that’s fair, and she does act like she’s enjoying it when she does it. But then there are times where she says that it’s skemthjng I “make” her do, which again sorta makes me feel guilty about it. On this same point, i also love finishing in my partners mouth, but this is something she has never tried and categorically told me will never do. I would be fine with this if she’d tried it, but we have never done anything without a condom ever (and I’m her first partner). It’s just weird to me. I would probably try most things my partner would ask me to at least once. TLDR: I have some kinks, my girlfriend sometimes shames me for them. I’m her first partner, and she never tries anything outside her comfort zone.
Me and my fiance were together 7 years ago. His sister falsely accused me of raping her younger brother because she caught us kissing which led to public humiliation from his family and me not wanting to do anything with his family and breaking up with him. 7 years later a.k.a. now, we got back together. We are currently in a LDR. His sister is using all ways and means to break me and him apart again, so she starts cursing me all the time in front of him up to the point where she brings my mother into this. So this has been going on for the past 8 months and I have had it up to my limit and I don't know what else to do anymore. &#x200B; \*\*TL;DR\*\* **:** Fiance's sister is causing problems to our relationship and I need advice.
EDITED TO ADD: Well, I made it. I had both red and brown blood every time I wiped from Friday through Monday morning when I went in. The D&C itself was as good of an experience as I could have hoped for. My pain and bleeding have been very limited since yesterday, thankfully. Looking forward to healing - thank you for all the support! I found out on Monday that our sweet baby's heartbeat stopped 2 days prior at 8 weeks 3 days. My D&C is scheduled for Monday am, but I went to the bathroom an hour ago and had bright red blood when I wiped. I'm having some moderate cramps and some blood but only when I wipe (nothing in pad). Is it possible I'll make it to my d&c Monday? I really, really, really DO NOT want to miscarry naturally but my doctor basically said I might make it and I might miscarry this weekend, to take ibuprofen, and to go to ER if I hemorrhage. :(
my mom always nags me to do chores that i should know i need to do and just do them by now (i'm 16). today i forgot to put away some chocolate (i was more worried about big finals + projects, being judged for my behavior by visiting family, friendship fights general stuff i care too much about etc) and my dog got into it and we had to call poison control (thankfully, she's ok). my mom raised her voice at me about how things like this always happen (they do) and it was made worse by the fact that this was supposed to be a really special day for her (she's graduating). she called me irresponsible and compared me to other kids she knows my age who would *never* do this. i explained to her the rationale the best i could. she responded saying that other kids know better and that i am basically just as normal as they are, i responded w the fact that i recently started taking medication because anxiety *is* a problem affecting my wellbeing. since i've learned more about + begun to receive treatment for anxiety, she's been calling me out for using it as an "excuse" for everything that i do wrong to make her feel bad but i see it as an explanation for why i mess basic stuff on. i don't want to use one problem i have to prevent me from being blamed for the others but at the same time i feel they're connected? idk tldr; i don't know how to remember what's important– dog got sick. mom is angry. help
So my (26, f) boyfriend (31, m) and I have been together for about 2.5 years. To get right to the point, he's made forum posts as well as in person comments that I've seen (that he may or may not know I've seen, I'm not certain), talking about his facial hair in particular, and saying that he, himself, does not enjoy wearing facial hair, but that he's convinced it works to attract women (commenting that he's gotten laid more with facial hair). He made these comments prior to dating me, however- now he has facial hair. a lot of it. and it scratches my face, makes me break out, and I personally do not find it attractive. he knows all of this. One time, and one time ever, I complained about it-didnt ask him to shave it, just complained that it hurts to kiss him- and he completely lost it and pouted for days. Long story short, he still has his facial hair. I legitimately dont like kissing him because it breaks me out, and we havent kissed in weeks. I wouldnt ask him to shave, and I wouldnt necessarily expect him to, but after a few weeks it kinda seems like the message im getting is that he cares more about the attention he gets from other women that whether his own girlfriend is comfortable. I havent said anything, but the longer this goes on, the more im sort of pissed off about it. Is this weird? am I wrong? tl;dr my boyfriend keeps facial hair that he knows is uncomfortable for me because he thinks it attracts other women. what do you make of this? what would you do?
to start, i am not normally an anxious person whatsoever. I dont dwell on things, im fairly spontaneous and easygoing, you get the idea. However, i started dating this girl around 2 years back and sleeping over with her more often than not. I love her quite a lot (and she loves me, luckily). The problem is that now when im not with her at night, as soon as the lights go out i get uncomfortably anxious. I jump at normal creaks and bumps from the house, i worry about myself or her, i start to think negatively, and its hard to push lots of bad thoughts away and calm myself down to sleep. Is this seperation anxiety or something different? anything i can do to fix it? This is very strange and new to me...
I don't know how to do this properly... I know it sucks whenever anyone's parent dies, but.. God, I wish I had more time to make her happy and proud. My mother was diagbosed with two stage 4 independent cancers when I was starting a useless degree. All we were told was, she had cancer and her days were numbered. Thankfully, I switched the next year to a less useless degree that I love, but still, the stench of failure lingered throughout my regular visits to her chemo sessions. Three years later, she has passed away. I know it sounds selfish, but... there's this feeling I didn't do nearly enough for her. And I didn't apply myself in ways that would have made her feel good. She always told us to get on with our lives, she assured me she was proud of me and that I was a good son whenever I voiced my concerns to her. What did I make of her life on this earth? She was a popular, widely loved and widely loving person. She loved children and, though devoutly christian, always supported the ideas of the new generations. She will not see her grandchildren. All I can hope is that she reached a higher level of understanding these past four years. However, nothing will make me forget the sheer physical pain she had to endure the past months. It was not some motivational type stuff, that you can put an inspiring end to. She didn't talk to us much during the last weeks. She didn't have the physical strength to do so. I don't know. Please take your parents' happiness more seriously than I did my mother's. All I can hope is that "being there" for her was enough.
My partner was murdered last week, I am still 100% in shock, he was my rock for all things. Tomorrow is also the anniversary of my fathers death. Right now, my cat (my dads cat, became mine when he passed, basically the last thing I have left of my dad) is very very sick. He has been sick for a while, but he wasn’t in pain so we’ve been waiting to make “the” decision until the time comes. Well, it seems like the time is here right now, he is showing signs that he is in pain. Im trying to decide if I should be there when we put him to sleep. I really don’t know if I can go through anymore trauma right now, but I might regret it if I don’t say goodbye. I don’t know what to do, my moms are waiting to hear back from the emergency vet, and I need to make the decision if I wanna be there or not in the next hour. I don’t have my partner here to help me through this like he was supposed to (my cat went downhill hours before my partner was killed). I don’t know what to do, any advice will help.
My partner of 2.5 years has been struggling for the past several months with chronic lower back pain. After a lot of urging he's attempting to find a medical solution, but in the meantime it's affecting our relationship pretty seriously. The chronic pain makes him extremely irritable and unable to cope with any small issues. He's started having frequent angry outbursts over the smallest things (never violent and usually not even directed towards me) and simple responsibilities completely overwhelm him sometimes. When I try to have conversations about his behavior he gets upset and blames it all on the pain, but I believe a lot of it is stress and anxiety related as well. I'm trying my hardest to be extremely patient and understanding, but his irritability is starting to rub off on me and sometimes I'm not as patient as I wish I was. He's not fun to be around most of the time anymore, especially after a long day of work, and I'm worried if this continues I won't want to be with him anymore. I know chronic pain sucks, but is it too much to ask for him to work on this behavior if he's still experiencing the pain? --- **tl;dr**: Boyfriend's chronic pain makes him angry and irritable all the time. How do I cope, and what can I ask from him?
I like this girl who has severe anxiety. She's open about it, but she's missed classes because of it, (which also adds onto her anxiety because she falls behind a little in classes, and she worries about deadlines). I've been texting her (not a lot) just to show concern and let her know what she's missed in class. She appreciates the concern and hopes to recover enough to regularly attend classes again. (She's attending classes again but has to leave early sometimes when her anxiety gets bad). I really like her, but I don't know if I should let her know/ask her out because I feel like something like that might give her something else to think about. If she rejects me, I'm fine with it as long as we can stay friends, but should I tell her how I feel? I would also like to add that I have small anxiety-like symptoms where I overthink about her and I also am extremely worried for her all the time because she also has other medical conditions. I also worry that if I tell her, she'd not want to be friends since it may make things awkward. So, yeah... should I tell her how I feel or not?
That's how I felt most of my life. I hve been living in a constant fear that I am an impostor. Maybe I am not as good as everyone considering, not worthy of their love, not worthy of anything good. My thoughts trouble me alot, I constantly get a peek to my inner self, and I am disgusted at all the negativity that I carry. I have got no one close to me with whom I can share my feelings. I seem to drive people away, even if they stay and try to make me feel good about myself, I feel like I am deceiving them. How can someone possibly think I am good after spending time with me? I have been a constant source of negativity and troubles for people around me, I am awed at how much shit some people are willing to take from me and yet not hate me. I have so much aspirations for my future but I can't seem to work towards them or focus on them due to everything that goes in my mind all the time. Sleep seems like a nice escape at times.
My grandfather just died. It was pretty expected, but I live across the world. I can't go home for the funeral. I saw him just last week on my visit home, and we spoke on the phone (I spoke, he managed 'I love you') two days ago when he was still awake, but of course that never feels like enough when you don't have any more chances. I don't get to hear him call me sweet girl, he won't email me any more science articles just because they reminded him of me. I can't see him or hug him anymore. It all just sucks and I am so sad it hurts and I want to be okay but right now it just sucks.
I was just looking out the window at the snow coming down and for a split second thought about texting my mom to see what she was doing for the day. It’s been a little over a year since she’s passed and this isn’t the first time this has happened to me. This time it was a little different though. In the past, when I would remember that she’s gone I would get a sinking feeling in my stomach and start to cry from the weight of the grief. Today however, it didn’t sit so hard. I still feel the grief, but maybe because I’ve gone through this more than a few times my body knows that I’ll get through it? I still miss her more than ever but the initial sense of it being unbearable is wearing off. I know that life will move on, and it’s sad that she’s not here, but I also know that I’ll be ok and that is comforting.
I'm so upset at myself. My boyfriend surprised me with an amazing, fancy dinner for our one year anniversary yesterday. I already wasn't feeling well when he told me we were going to dinner but when I saw what he planned I didn't have the heart to tell him I wasn't that hungry. In the end I pushed myself to eat the fixed menu he ordered for us and the bill was over $500, I couldn't handle it and after dessert I ended up going to the bathroom and throwing it all up. I can't believe I wasted so much of his money and am so disappointed in myself for not speaking up and simply saying I didn't feel well. I feel like I've wasted the effort he put into planning this. I also feel like I missed out on some amazing food that we would usually never splurge for. He doesn't know I threw it up and I just told him I loved it because regardless of how I felt health wise I loved that he put in so much effort to make sure I felt special. But I can't stop stewing in my own feelings. Help! :( TL;DR my boyfriend is amazing and bought us an expensive anniversary dinner. Threw it all up, he doesn't know. Feel horrible guilt and FOMO
Hello I'm 23 year old male with 24 year old gf and 2 year old child. So I have anger and jealous and possessive problems. I grew up in a very harsh environment where everyone was always mean to each other and men always harsh to my mother. I've always told myself I never wanted to be this kind of guy that Is jealous but I have not been able to manage my emotions throughout this relationship. I've never physically harmed my girlfriend. I know emotional is worse . our life is stable for the most part material wise. I really don't know to get help for myself or what to do. Feel free to ask me anything . I'm not sure were to start. This is a first time post for me.
Sorry for any spelling errors in advance, english isn't my first language. Two days ago I started having really strange moments, it's mostly when reading something in a videogame or as a subtitle from a movie/tv show. The words just kinda echo in my head and everything around me feels really fake. The moments only last for about a second. It doesn't seem that bad and I don't know why it bothers me so much but it's making me feel terrible. I never had it before but in the last two days I've had those moments about every half an hour when I'm whatching tv or playing a videogame and every two hours when I'm not.
My friend since elementary overdosed for the 3rd time and almost didn’t make it this time. He was rushed to the hospital and had to have his stomach pumped and is now in rehab for the next year. He’s also only 14 and hated his family life and that’s why he got into drugs. I really miss him I haven’t talked to him in over 4 months since he’s been at rehab. Ever since his 3rd overdose I have been getting super distant with everyone and I don’t really feel, like I’m dead on the inside. I will probably never see or talk to him until we’re out of high school because his parents aren’t giving him his phone back till he’s 18 and they also said he can’t hangout with anyone until he’s 18. I really miss him and I hope he doing fine now and I hope when he gets out of rehab he won’t get back into drugs. When he overdosed for the 3rd time that was enough for me to quit everything I’m 4 months clean but I haven’t had emotions in 4 months. I just needed to get this off my chest.
Today is 6 months. Last night I dreamed we were at a party and he was trying to convince me he wasn’t sick and he hadn’t died. I had to explain to him that he was wrong, and he was so confused and argued with me, enough that I believed him until I woke up. This is not the first time. Last month I dreamed he was in our house working and I had to tell him he can’t stay here because he’s not alive, then told him how he died. He was devastated and cried in my lap on our basement floor. I have enough trouble explaining to our three year old daughter why Dad can’t come back, I don’t know why I also have to explain it to him
I was in the office at my school and overheard a young kid say he played some cool games and hobbies with his friend, the office worker then said, "Isn't it nice to have a friend you always have a hobby with." And I kinda thought to myself I didn't really have a real friend like that. I guess I never made a friend that had the same hobbies as me. I don't know, I have a lot of friends or mutual ones at least but it truly showed how much I didn't have a true homie ever since like elementary school lol. It get's lonely studying for my future and going to college soon this year and not having that "person". Really showed my life is maturing but it made me depressed in a way.
Every time she texts me she says my name for example "Hey/Hi/Hello (My name) which I find weird since it is clear who she is talking to since my name is clearly under my snapchat. When we was taking a mid term she looked to see if I have left already and she noticed I saw her do that and looked way quickly. She also texts me to see if we have hw when we barely get hw assigned in class and I know she knows when we have HW or not **TL;DR** she says my name when texting, she checks up on me, texts me for hw to start convos. Does she like me?
Bilbo was an absolutely amazing friend, a wonderful listener, and quite possibly the most perfect creature I have ever met. He had a coughing fit last week and passed out for a few seconds. We took him to the vet and they did an x-ray on his chest. They found what is most likely cancer, but before we could formulate a plan he stopped eating. We made the merciful decision as he was 12 years old and I didn't want him to suffer. His last day he got lots of visitors and loves, we got to go to the river one last time to sit in the sun. The vet came to our house at 5:30 and we sat in the yard and said goodbye. We told him we loved him and thanked him for spending his life with us. The process was very peaceful. I am absolutely heartbroken, but we did the right thing for him. I have no idea how to recover from this or go on without him. Everything reminds me of him.
So I have borderline zero social skills, almost as awkward as they come, and I had the audacity to try a few pairs of shoes on and not make a purchase. The problem with having said lack of social skills and copious amounts of anxiety, I get confused as to the best course of action in any given scenario. In one instance I don’t want to be a dick, but then I also want to have the strength to not be an absolute doormat in every situation. I clearly irritated the guy, and now I feel like fucking shit and my classic irrationally is telling me I’m a terrible person and I should be ashamed of myself. This sort of dread is pretty typical across the spectrum of potentially negative social encounters, this just happened to be todays. Idk exactly why I’m typing this, just in the off chance someone can relate maybe.
My brother died after being in a brief coma Feb 2019 after he had just turned 27. Now my uncle is in the same boat currently as of last night. On life support, not breathing for himself, etc. Exactly the same as brother back then. I am having grief flashbacks and he is not even dead...yet. I feel guilty about thinking of him as already dead but the doctors said the same thing and my brother ended up being brain dead. We got to donate his organs but my uncle has many health problems so that probably won't be the case this time. I hope he pulls through but I'm thinking more in after mode at this time. Life sucks sometimes.
When I was younger I was a heavy kid. Not huge but noticeably pudgy. My freshman year the week leading up to homecoming I had prepared to ask this girl I had liked since elementary school. Then she told me that a kid asked her. We were friends so I acted like I was super happy for her but in reality I was super disappointed that my big plan had been ruined. My parents had planned to go to a concert the day I was going to homecoming and my mother being the person she is waited till the night before to buy me something. I had practice so I couldn’t go with her to see what she bought but trusted she would buy something I would be comfortable with. The day of homecoming when it was finally time for me to get ready I was all alone and had to rely on myself since my parents were at their concert. I started to put the shirt on and it was at least a size and a half too small. The pants were way too big and I couldn’t figure out how to tie a tie for my life. I live in California and the evenings aren’t always so cool so on top of all of this I had sweat through my dress shirt. Finally I gave up and got undressed and instead watched Netflix alone. My sister was mad at me and I was mad at my mom. The whole thing now sounds like something out of a dramedy but I lived it.

And I'm super stressed. I'm sixteen years old and it's a University level English class (online course). If I don't pass this class, I won't graduate next year. I don't know what to do. The whole course is crammed into a months worth of work and I'm so overwhelmed. The online courses' format is so confusing and I can't ask easily ask for help like I can in school. English isn't my strong-suit and gives me anxiety whenever I look at it. I already have five late assignments and it's just going downhill from there. I know I'm gong to fail it or drop out of the course. Honestly I'd be happy to be a year behind, my mental health is more important I think. What do I do?
Hello reddit! I recently joined this sub after breaking my phone out of rage and I now have considered taking some anger management. First of all, I'm pretty chill when I'm with people. I rarely get angry at them and all. Although, when I'm on my phone it usually triggers me (phone not responding, not able to make calls, etc.). I'm currently 18 and I'm now suffering without a phone and all I have is a laptop. My parents would most likely send my phone for repairs (Hopefully). For now, I wanna reduce my rage on my tech. I'm a bit of a tech geek and it is kinda odd for me to break my devices out of anger. I've probably broke 3 phones including my current smashed screen one out of rage. I really wanna stop raging on my tech because it is very very costly. I'm still lucky to have this laptop which is 2 years. Unlike my current phone which is less than a year sadly. It is a new model (released 2019). The point is how do I control my anger when my devices are doing a bad job? I wanna end this rage of breaking phones and laptops.
I think about dying a lot but not actually doing it or anything. I think about how it would impact everyone around me. But that’s not what I had to actually write about, I don’t even know why it came up. I’m not suicidal or anything whatsoever. I would never. I am however very sad and idk how to feel anymore. I’m a person without feelings now. I don’t matter but I still walk around having to pretend my smiles and hide my emotions. I feel like whenever I express my emotions it’s never taken lightly and people get upset over it and try to defend why I shouldn’t feel that way. There’re people I can talk to but it always end up with me saying sorry and my emotions becoming disregarded. Reddit, I feel like, is the only place I could go to and talk about anything.
Been living together for over 2 years. We just moved into a new apartment. She is a great person and has done so much for me. I wouldn't be where am I now without her. I have a crush on someone I work with. I need to break up with my SO because I don't feel this way for her. I guess I realized that I'm only with her because everything is comfortable. I want to be with someone I love. My coworker and I flirt with each other all day at work, sneak out for lunch together, she looks at me when she laughs during meetings, we go on long walks after work, I'm normally pretty clueless but I'd be really surprised to find out she doesn't have feelings for me too. This has been going on for months. She also has an SO. I feel really bad about all of this, like I'm a disgusting person but the fact is, I can't control who I have feelings for. I'm only human. Even if it doesn't work out with my coworker it's important to me that I have these feelings for the person I'm going to be with. I didn't know I could feel this way for anyone again. The last time I've felt these kinds of intense feelings was when I was a teenager. --- **tl;dr**: I don't love my SO and I have feelings for a coworker (possibly reciprocal). Should I leave my SO? Should I tell my coworker how I feel? I just want to be happy.
At 55 you were taken from me way too early. The morning dad rang me and told me you have had a stroke and I need to find a way to fly home is the day that has changed my life forever...you were fit, you were healthy and you are my mum...and I never made it home to you. I always told SO I would never cope without you, and here I am sitting here not coping. It’s been 10 days now but those 10 days have felt like a life time of hurt. I will never forget you and will never stop loving you to the moon and back mum. *thank you for anyone who read this, I really just needed to vent and write some words down*
My (very cute)bestfriend of about 7 years isn't into boys, and I told him a year ago I had feelings for him, in hopes of somehow helping me get over it, but fast forward 12 months and now I love him so much, I didn't even know I could feel this way about someone. I think about him all the time, talk to him all the time, dream about him nearly every night. I trust him with everything, care deeply about his wellbeing, get furious if people shit on him. He whispered in my ear last week when we were with friends, and his face was like 1cm away from mine and goddamn it felt like i was an inch away from everything i ever wanted. We tell each other everything, blah blah perfect friendship, basically. I say all of that because I don't think I can do the whole "hey we can't be friends because I love you too much" thing, but I know my feelings aren't healthy. I want him to be happy, but when he tells me he's going on a date with a girl, I get jealous and sometimes annoyed at him, and sometimes after we hang out and I get back home, I just lay on my bed and cry. If I could have anything in the world it would for him to feel the same way about me. So, my feelings are crazy nuts and not healthy and are making me sad, but I don't want to stop being best friends, so reddit, help me please because I do not know what to do. **TL;DR In love with straight best friend, do not want to stop being best friends, but need advice on how to get over him or control my feelings**
My \[16F\] mother \[45F\] gets really angry when I make even the most minor of mistakes. However, she isn't like this when my five sisters \[20F, 18F, 16F, 15F, 13F\] make small mistakes. Our mother has taught us to do everything herself - like vacuuming, doing the dishes, cleaning the toilet etc. Whenever one of my sisters made a small boo-boo doing one of the tasks, our mum would say things to make them feel better about themselves. This includes "*Don't worry sweetie, we can always do it again. Practise does make perfect*." &#x200B; However, whenever I made a boo-boo doing something, she always yelled at me at the top of her voice. Some things she would say include, "*Oh my god, you're so bloody useless at this*!", "*UGHHH, can't you do ANYTHING right*?" and *"You are getting on my bloody nerves*." She would then precede to do it herself, and she will never let me do it again. &#x200B; It feels like I'm her least favourite child of her six children. All this has made me feel like I can't do anything right. &#x200B; \------------------------------------------- TL;DR - It feels like I'm a big disappointment to her.
I'm always had anger issues as long as I could remember, it got worse and escalated over the years, my anger definitely got out of control at a few different points... In the last year or two I had been doing very well with my anger, idk how i did it or why but i was doing great. My dad passed away about 4 months ago and in the last month-and-a-half I found it very difficult to deal with my anger again, it's always over the little things and it's starting to affect my work environment and my friendships. I've lost it at work a few times in the last month but tonight was really bad, i was kind of a dick at work all day, broke down a few times and was angry at the wrong person.... overall really really bad day.....and it resulted in a fight with my co-worker friend and roommate (all one person) it wasn't until after the whole situation that I realized I was pissed that my dad's not here. I explained what has been going on and apologized but i was an asshole and i still feel really bad.... Im getting pissed at everything again because my dad's gone and I don't know how I stopped being angry the first time or why and I don't know how to do it again. But it's making me sad and it's fucking everything up for me and i feel terrible, im sorry for the long post im just disappointed in myself and dont know how to stop being so mad about nothing...but if anybody has any advice I'd appreciate thanks for your time
I had gone for a check up a few weeks ago and was told that I had an early miscarriage and an empty sac. I was 8 weeks at the time and I am coming up on my 12th week. They told me I should wait for it to come out naturally within the next 4 weeks and if it doesn’t to come back and to get surgery to avoid infections. I want to know how much longer can I actually wait to naturally miscarry before I have to go back to get it surgically removed? I’ve read that people have miscarried around 13 weeks because the body at 12 weeks recognizes that there’s an issue. However, I’m already on my 11th week coming up on my 12th week. I really want to miscarry naturally because I don’t feel comfortable enough to get the surgery. How long should I wait before consulting a doctor to get it surgically removed? What are your guys experiences with a missed miscarriage? How did you cope after and how did you prepare for it? Thanks.

None of my friend wished me happy birthday yesterday, wich was kind of weird because they had been asking for my birthday date and my male friend (mathis) birthday date, since we are born 3 days apart (him 18 and me 21 November). All of my friends are male (gang of 6 w me) and they all wished happy birthday to my mathis 4 days ago and I did too. But yesterday no one said happy birthday to me, they just texted like usually, and a lot. Not only that, but they also forgot to plan gift for both me and mathis. Me and mathis planned so that the gang would buy gift for them at their birthdays, but no one did for us. They told us they forgot and covid wasn’t helping wich was understandable. I was hoping at the very least they would tell me happy birthday but no one did and it was bothering me all day yesterday while I was with my family. The saddest part was that it bothered me so much yesterday that I dreamt last night about it. I received a text from them telling me happy birthday, and today I woke up thinking they had did it until I checked my discord. I cried a little because my birthday wasn’t very celebrated yesterday because we don’t have a lot of money, and so yesterday wasn’t very special, and I was really waiting for them to make my day special because I love them a lot and they didn’t.
i met my best friend i my old school and we were inseparable, we would play video games together, we would chill out at the beach and then we made a group we named it the coup and we didn't thing much of it then we lost a member and we leaned from what we did and we moved on from it, then our group became popular we gained 10 to 12 more members and we got excited so we made a discord and so on and so forth, we played gta, minecraft and even fortnite then we stopped playing those games and started playing payday 2 and we fucking loved it so much few days later we met this guy named Up2-No-Good and he was so weird, he would moan into the mic and make gay jokes and it started to get annoying but my bff said maybe he is gay and i didn't care as much then he started to hit on me and i'm not gay so i got furious and kicked him from the call, he then proceeded to threaten me so my bff invited him to a separate call (the story isn't sad at this point but it will) and he made me and him apologize but i didn't need to so he left and got off ten minutes later i get a invite by my bff and he told me that he wants to make new friends and me and him stopped being friends and he unfriended me but i will always leave that friend request right where i left it
I’m a 17 year old typical teenage girl and am trying to bring myself to end a casual relationship or ‘friends with benefits’ relationship with a fellow guy I met at my part-time job (also 17 years old). I truly do like him, and can’t stop rolling my eyes at myself for falling so quickly for someone. It’s been around 4 months now and it really has not been an easy four months. He’s the first guy who I’ve ever done anything with and so I am a potato with zero experience. I’ve tried breaking it off with him completely but I always fail and meet with him again. It hurts that I know he won’t commit to me so I know this time I must succeed. I still wouldn’t mind remaining friends with him but I don’t know how to say that to him or if it would even work. He’s very intelligent so our chats are always fun. I can’t see him taking me seriously since I’ve ‘broken up’ with him so many times. Why am I such an unstable and unstoppable moron? tl;dr Guy I’m hooking up with won’t commit, I still like him. Should I go with the flow or break it off?
I am 2 months out from the death of my husband. We were married 20 years and were pretty happy since we stopped working and mostly stayed up on the mountain. During the first month I was looping on the intensity of the illness, hospitalization, his death and all the millions of medical details. Over and over. He died just 2 weeks after his diagnosis. I couldn’t believe it was really happening. Now I am beginning to see the shape of what I have lost and the utter permanence of this new situation. This morning (I had been up since 3:30am)and was washing my sheets when I realized that I had accidentally washed his pillowcase…the one that still had his scent, the one I sleep with. I turned into a crazy, wailing person as I frantically rummaged through his dirty laundry basket searching for a dirty T-shirt, one that still had his scent. I think I scared my cats but I found one. Does anyone else find they are holding onto there lost partners scent? Soon enough I expect it will be gone and he just seems to get further away every day. I never expected this would happen to him and here I am. God damn it.
I came to post this here for help. My 24yo boyfriend is dealing with anger issues and our fights all turn to be violent he once chocked me with murder intention. When he's mad he doesn't know what he's doing he's totally another person he doesn't even listen to me. When I try to talk he's almost all the time like "you have no right to talk I am the one to decide what you do". We've been fighting for a whole week I had my PMS I didn't know what I was doing he's most of the time understanding when I'm on my PMS but not this time he wasn't in the mood to actually think of what I'm going through some things happened and he just turned violent on me yelling and hitting me when something happens. Most of jobs he lost were because of his anger and he usually get out to fight when he's way too angry. And after we actually sat on the table and talked he begged me to help him in managing his anger and I really do wanna help him. I was a shy person who can't even look at people's face nor have a proper conversation with anyone he helped me to change and be a better person now I wanna help him back. P.S: Sorry for my bad English tho
Basically, I ended up in only classes that I'm not remotely interested in this semester, which I've never experienced before, and that compounded with a major depressive episode over the last few weeks made me just stop going, to the point that I don't think my grades are salvageable. My therapist and I had a long discussion, and I came to the decision that this is the best thing I can do. I'm withdrawing for the semester, working with financial aid so I can avoid losing funding, and I'm going to spend the summer working and figuring things out and start again in the fall. Consciously, I feel better than I have in weeks because of this, but the thing is, I'm an engineer, honor student and former AP kid who never experienced a C before college, much less a dropped class, and part of me feels like it's a failure I can't come back from. I don't know how to talk to my family about this, and what I'm most afraid of is that it's not actually going to help me. I thought this would be a good place to talk about it, since the people here are more likely to know how I feel than the people in my life. Any advice from people who have been in similar situations? How do I approach the subject with the people close to me?
Since my early 20s I've been in a boatload of inappropriate, chaotic, horrible relationships. I'm talking cheating, physical abuse, all of that. I have also been in "relationships" with 2 married men. Every one of these have ended in disaster and chaos, not surprising. I have analyzed myself, my childhood, my philosophies, my everything. I have been to therapy for a short while. I do see, on a logical level, what is wrong with me. But it doesn't help me heal. I mean, I am taking a break from dating so I can stop ruining my own life, but I just feel broken on the inside. My view of romance and stability and marriage are all kinds of fucked up. I know what I've done to avoid being caught, I know all my own stupid justifications, I know the mental gymnastics I've done to convince myself it's okay, you're okay. I feel like I will always have a part of me that doesn't trust my partner, no matter what he does or says. And if in marriage, I am ever cheated on or hurt in any other way, ultimately, my first thoughts will be "this is karma" and "I knew this would happen." And I will be devastated but also not surprised. I will feel like I deserve it. How can I ever trust someone again if I know how evil people can be? I mean, I've done all the evil things I could possibly do to a person. I know everyone is capable of it, if I am. How do I reconcile this with myself? TLDR: I'm a cheater, I've been abused, I've done horrible things in relationships and have trouble trusting most partners. I don't know if I will ever recover from that. How do I trust again?
So I’ve been friends with this girl since high school and the other day I went over to her house and we were just talking and watching one of our favorite shows. Then we started cuddling and she kissed me when I left and it made me feel on top of the world. But now I’m so scared that this could turn into a failed talking stage and won’t go any further that I feel depressed and more lost than I have in a long time. I haven’t had a very good history with relationships and I’ve been used and cheated on a lot so I’ve closed myself off from people a lot in the past year. I’ve felt hopeless about finding anybody that will care about me and want to be with me because of this. I’m so scared that this won’t work out like my other relationships because I’m too afraid to open up or that I might go the opposite direction and become so suddenly attached that I seem unappealing. I don’t know how to talk about this because I feel like I’m just over thinking and it will be fine but at the same time I can’t help but feel like I won’t be able to get past my own insecurities and I don’t know how to deal with it :(
I’m really struggling today, I’m in the middle of end of year law exams and I know I’m really stressed because of that too but I wish I could have time to reflect and be with my partner but he’s on a uni placement that is so far away that we just get first thing in the morning and the nights and it means I spend all this time alone revising but also thinking about how I’d have had our tiny bean by now, I’d have held him and that I wouldn’t even be in uni to do these exams. I love my degree I just feel so disconnected this last few months and I miss having my partner around for more hours in a day where we’re less tired so we could talk about stuff like this. I won a big award yesterday for making an outstanding extracurricular contribution to the life of our uni and I was so sad because my partner barely made it because of how long and far away his placement is. I’m sorry for being so pessimistic and I know we’ll be okay but today I’m dying of revision I don’t feel like I’m strong enough to do this on my own. I wasn’t ready to be a mum but I wasn’t ready for having it taken away either.❤️
So me and my friend were going to skip school on tuesday to go to Tayto Park (an entertainment park in Ireland)my Mum and his mum were aware of this and fine with it.My mum said i could go and I was happy with that.In school today i was excited and talking to my friend a lot.So the school day ends and as me and my mum are driving home she says to me "Im sorry but dad says you cant go".I was sooooo pissed off.This is my dads revenge for me getting his headset broken (I annoyed my sister and she threw the headset at me and broke it)If anyone has any sugestion on how to calm down or to convince me to let me go that would be good.
Do I have an anger management problem or is it just normal anger to normal events? I don’t know. I do know that when I lose my temper I yell.... I lose my temper when I am stressed or frustrated....when I do t know what people want from me. Sometimes the people I lash out at will say that they feel abused when I yell at them. It was said today, and it makes me concerned. I don’t want to abuse people. I don’t want to lose my temper. It just happens... quick like a flash. They are saying I have a problem so I must have a problem. That said. I need help. Where do I start? I see a therapist for the anxiety and the depression. Should I see her about the anger? How do I recognize when I am getting angry when it happens so quickly. Saying sorry afterwards means nothing when I say sorry all the time for so many other things. A push in the right direction would be appreciated. Thank you for you help.
When I get angry I fill with rage. I never hit, I never break things, never have I just ran away from my problems, hell, I don't even yell or scream. Instead, I "tackle" the situation and just verbally fuck shit up. If I'm alone and I get bad news or something/someone pisses me off I just chug a redbull, turn on metal, and go to town to burn off my anger. Which is healthy, I guess. But when I'm around whoever is making me angry, I just give my honest opinion on the situation with some "fancy" words and a sarcastic tone of voice. I calmly tear people apart from the inside with my words. This is healthier than just beating people or going all "HULK SMASH!!" but it's still wrong, and I know that. I just can't help it. And the scariest thing about it is that I can just switch it on and off whenever I want, but when I do I can't control it.
I have to expose and I do not get it as before, before I was one of the best people in the field of exposing issues and projects in school, I feel horribly terrified of exposing Friday in classes and Monday in the library in an exhibition published among students, teachers and parents, I feel that in the exhibition of the project I will have an anxiety attack and I will speak too quickly, that I will forget the things that I have to talk about or that my project will not be good enough As if to deserve a qualification, the project is 50% of the grade of this semester and I feel that if I screw up I am lost since I can not have a next opportunity in school and I will be expelled. I feel disgusting. Any help to avoid these problems?
This has been fucking eating me up since yesterday and I am getting so pissed off about it. My mom raised her kids to believe that men and women are equal and women can do the same as a man. Just yesterday, they fucking went on about even the best fathers are shitty at raising children... with me in there to hear it all. I feel like they're trying to get a rise out of me. It really hurts to hear your own mother say your stupid or just terrible at something just because your a certain gender, especially if the person raises you to believe that men and women are "equal".
I just got out of my d&c a couple of hours ago. I just have minor cramping and honestly I feel empty? Maybe it’s mental or something but I feel like my baby is gone for good. It’s bringing up a lot of feelings. The hardest part of it was the waiting to be honest. First waiting for an appointment to see the Gyno after ER confirmed no heartbeat (6days). Then waiting for the surgery itself (2days after that appointment). I had to check in at 9:30am, the surgery was supposed to be at 12:50pm but I wasn’t in the operating room until 1:45pm. I don’t know where I was going with this post but I just felt I needed to share my journey.
... Gone are the days of free speech and indiscriminate, untargeted opinions. People of color in the "sex industry" , Be wary of sharing content exposing more than "average dress", buttcracks, or even cleavage line. These are now apparently considered "obscene nudity /graphic violence". So with that being said, you're apparently not allowed to share links to "outside websites" containing such graphic either. That makes it VERY sticky for up and coming public figures to share their own content and still speak on important political issues that do matter. We often forget that the porn so many view for free is paid for by someone, whether it's the form of ads or membership fees on a site for top access. But it all starts with a dream or a production plan, then takes money, a set of actors and camera guy, like we've been doing the past 50+ years. Not much has changed, except for the politics around it and permission of who is and who isn't allowed to shoot on screen... But the worst thing social media can do is silence the voice of an actor for being "different". Not a bad person, just different.
I go once a week. I have for a while. I schedule at the end of every appointment and it has been fine. Sometimes I don't get a Monday and have to go Wednesday. Boo hoo. This time they tell me nothing for nearly a month. I'm going through a really bad anxiety relapse, and this is extremely distressing to me. I have scheduled the next several months in advanced following the date, so it won't happen again. Until then, they said they'll call me if they have cancellations. How often, in your experience, does this pan out? I remember having moderate success with a neurologist on this years ago. It's almost a guarantee with my GP to call at 8 am and get a same day appointment due to cancellations, even if he's booked weeks out. USA.
